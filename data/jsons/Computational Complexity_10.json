  "abstract": "Understanding how fast physical systems can resemble Haar-random unitaries is a fundamental question in physics. Many experiments of interest in quantum gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve queries to a random unitary 𝑈 alongside its inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , and transpose 𝑈 𝑇. However, conventional notions of approximate unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions achieve the optimal circuit depth of 𝒪(log 𝑛) for systems of 𝑛 qubits. We further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that strong PRUs can form in circuit depth poly(log 𝑛) in circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic times.",

        "Understanding how fast a quantum system can scramble information is a fundamental question with implications throughout quantum science. In quantum computing, quantum information scrambling by random circuits enables efficient device benchmarking [1][2][3][4], quantum state tomography [5][6][7], and quantum advantage demonstrations [8][9][10]. In quantum cryptography [11][12][13], scrambling is characterized by the computational indistinguishability of quantum circuits from Haar-random unitaries, and enables new cryptographically secure protocols. In fundamental physics, scrambling and the emergence of Haar-random unitary behaviors provide powerful theoretical tools for modeling complex phenomena across diverse areas, from quantum many-body dynamics [14][15][16] to quantum chaos and thermalization [17][18][19] to quantum gravity and black hole physics [20][21][22][23][24].",
        "Across all of these contexts, a central question concerns the minimum time required to scramble quantum information. This question is crucial for quantum technologies: the shorter the time required, the more experimentally applicable random unitary protocols become. In physics, this question is captured by the fast scrambling conjecture, proposed by Sekino and Susskind [20], which states1 : Conjecture 1 (Fast scrambling conjecture, Sekino and Susskind [20]). The minimum time to scramble information in quantum systems of 𝑛 qubits under all-to-all connectivity is Θ(log 𝑛).",
        "In their original formulation, scrambling was characterized through entanglement growth: for every 𝑛-qubit pure state |𝜓⟩, every sufficiently small subsystem of the time-evolved state 𝑈 |𝜓⟩⟨𝜓| 𝑈 † should achieve near-maximal entanglement entropy in 𝒪(log 𝑛) time. However, the modern physical understanding of quantum information scrambling encompasses numerous signatures beyond entanglement growth, including, in physical studies, the decay of out-of-time-order correlators [25], information recovery protocols like the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment [21], and the saturation of operator size distributions and operator entanglement entropies to their Haar-random values [26].",
        "In recent years, indistinguishability from Haar-random has emerged as a powerful conceptual framework for characterizing scrambling: a system scrambles if its dynamics 𝑈 become operationally indistinguishable from Haar-random evolution in any physical experiment. Operational indistinguishability is commonly defined through approximate unitary 𝑘-designs [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) [11,[40][41][42]. The former guarantees that 𝑈 is indistinguishable from a Haar-random unitary within any quantum experiment that queries 𝑈 up to 𝑘 times, while the latter concerns any polynomial-time quantum experiment. These general operational frameworks offer a crucial advantage of also capturing any future scrambling diagnostics yet to be discovered. This naturally motivates the following operational formulation of the fast scrambling conjecture:",
        "Conjecture 2 (Operational fast scrambling conjecture). The minimum circuit depth to form 𝑛-qubit unitary 𝑘-designs (for constant 𝑘) and PRUs under all-to-all connectivity is Θ(log 𝑛).",
        "The past decade has seen remarkable progress in understanding the depths needed to form unitary designs and PRUs [11,[32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]. Unfortunately, standard notions of designs and PRUs possess two critical limitations, which undermine the utility of the fast scrambling conjecture formulated above.",
        "Limitation 1: Forward-only access. Standard unitary designs and PRUs only guarantee indistinguishability under forward queries to 𝑈 . However, many scrambling diagnostics require access to the inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 operations. For example, out-of-time-order correlators require time-reversal operations using 𝑈 † to be efficiently measured [44], while efficient information recovery in the Hayden-Preskill protocol requires complex conjugation 𝑈 * [45]. Similarly, recent work in quantum cryptography [46] suggests that the strongest notion of PRUs should allow access to all of 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 (as well as their controlled versions), reflecting the fact that a user with knowledge of the gates composing 𝑈 should be able to implement all these transformations.",
        "Standard designs and PRUs fail to capture these essential features. In fact, they do not even satisfy an Ω(log 𝑛) depth lower bound: recent work [39,47] shows that standard unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in Θ(log log 𝑛) depth, exponentially faster than the conjectured minimum scrambling time of Θ(log 𝑛). This demonstrates that forward-only indistinguishability is insufficient to capture the complete range of scrambling behaviors often desired in physics and cryptography.",
        "Limitation 2: Unphysical use of ancillary systems. All existing PRU constructions [36,40,42] over 𝑛 qubits require 𝑚 = poly(𝑛) ancilla qubits initialized to |0 𝑚 ⟩ and returned to |0 𝑚 ⟩ to achieve pseudorandomness on the original 𝑛 qubits. While this use of ancilla qubits is acceptable for cryptographic applications, it creates a fundamental mismatch when modeling physical quantum dynamics. Physical scrambling processes, whether in black holes or many-body quantum systems, operate on fixed Hilbert spaces and do not involve auxiliary degrees of freedom with fine-tuned initialization and finalization conditions. As a result, standard cryptographic PRUs do not necessarily provide appropriate evidence for physical scrambling processes.",
        "In this work, we address both of these limitations. First, we introduce strong unitary 𝑘-designs and strong pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), which are indistinguishable from Haar-random in any experiment that queries the unitary 𝑈 or its inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 . Second, we initiate the study of ancilla-free PRUs, which are PRUs with efficient ancilla-free circuit implementations. These definitions motivate a strengthened version of the fast scrambling conjecture: Conjecture 3 (Strong fast scrambling conjecture). The minimum depth to form 𝑛-qubit strong unitary designs and PRUs under all-to-all connectivity is Θ(log 𝑛), achievable without ancilla. This conjecture captures the strongest possible operational meaning of fast scrambling: quantum dynamics that remain indistinguishable from Haar-random under any efficient quantum experiment involving any combination of operations, realized using only the physical degrees of freedom.",
        "Our main results provide compelling evidence for, and an almost full resolution to, the strong fast scrambling conjecture:",
        "1. Strong unitary designs. We provide the first proof of existence for strong unitary designs and establish that the minimum depth to form them is precisely Θ(log 𝑛). This proves that every property measurable in finitely many queries scrambles in logarithmic time.",
        "2. Strong PRUs. We provide the first proof of existence for strong PRUs secure against all operations 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 and establish that the minimum depth to form them is precisely Θ(log 𝑛) under a well-established cryptographic assumption: subexponential hardness of learning with errors (LWE) [48]. This represents a significant advance over prior work [42], which requires poly(𝑛) depth and only achieved security against 𝑈 and 𝑈 † . Our result proves that every property measurable by polynomial-time experiments scrambles in logarithmic time.",
        "3. Ancilla-free constructions: We show that both strong unitary designs and strong PRUs can be implemented without using any ancilla qubits in poly(log 𝑛) depth. While slightly larger than the conjectured Θ(log 𝑛), this provides the first ancilla-free PRU construction for any security notion, including standard forward-only PRUs. These constructions are secure under the subexponential hardness2 of learning with errors [48].",
        "4. Generic emergence. We prove that all-to-all random circuits consisting of independent Haarrandom two-qubit gates form strong unitary designs in 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) depth, providing evidence that fast scrambling is a generic phenomenon rather than requiring careful engineering.",
        "All of our results immediately extend to quantum experiments with access to controlled versions of 𝑈, 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 , following the general reduction laid out in [49,50]. Our constructions of strong unitary designs and strong PRUs introduce several new random unitary ensembles and techniques for working with strong random unitaries. Our main technical contributions are threefold. First, we introduce the Luby-Rackoff-Function-Clifford (LRFC) ensemble and prove that it forms both strong unitary designs and strong PRUs. The LRFC ensemble adapts the Permutation-Function-Clifford (PFC) ensemble of [40], replacing the random permutation with a Luby-Rackoff construction to achieve exponentially lower circuit depths while maintaining security against all queries to 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , and 𝑈 𝑇 . Second, inspired by [36], we prove a gluing theorem for strong unitary designs and strong PRUs. This powerful technique allows us to reduce the circuit Figure 1: Illustration of our main results. (a) A strong approximate unitary 𝑘-design is a random unitary ensemble that is indistinguishable from Haar in any quantum experiment that queries 𝑈 or its inverse (i.e. time-reversal), conjugate, or transpose 𝑘 times. A strong pseudorandom unitary (PRU) is similarly indistinguishable in any polynomial-time experiment. (b) We construct strong unitary designs and PRUs on 𝑛 qubits in depth 𝒪(log 𝑛). Our constructions use long-range two-qubit gates to scramble quantum information over all 𝑛 qubits as fast as possible. (c) In comparison, low-depth one-dimensional quantum circuits can only scramble information over local regions. This allows them to form conventional designs [35,36] and PRUs [36], but not strong designs or strong PRUs. depth of our strong constructions to the optimal value of 𝒪(log 𝑛), which we prove is the minimum possible for any strong unitary design or strong PRU, and to establish strong unitary designs in depth 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) using all-to-all random circuits with Haar-random two-qubit gates. Third, to construct ancilla-free PRUs, we combine a new classical-to-quantum circuit compilation technique with our gluing theorems to construct standard PRUs in poly(log 𝑛) depth over 1D geometries and strong PRUs in poly(log 𝑛) depth over all-to-all geometries, both without using any ancilla qubits.",
        "Organization of this paper. Our manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define strong unitary designs and summarize our main results on their circuit depth. We also illustrate the failure of standard definitions of approximate unitary designs to capture experiments involving the time-reverse 𝑈 † and conjugate 𝑈 * . In Section 3, we define strong PRUs and summarize our main results on their circuit depth. In Section 4, we provide detailed descriptions of our constructions and proofs of strong unitary designs and PRUs. These involve three key ingredients as described above: the LRFC random unitary ensemble, a gluing construction for optimizing the circuit depth of strong random unitaries, and an adapted gluing construction for local random circuits. In Section 5, we discuss the relation between strong random unitaries and fast quantum information scrambling. We conclude in Section 6 with discussions and open questions."

        "Approximate unitary designs seek to mimic Haar-random unitaries in applications that involve a random unitary only a finite number of times. Let us first review their standard definitions and then provide our strong definition and summarize our main results on strong unitary designs.",
        "Background. An exact unitary 𝑘-design on 𝑛 qubits is a random unitary ensemble ℰ whose 𝑘th moment, Φ ℰ (•) ≡ E 𝑈 ∼ℰ [𝑈 ⊗𝑘 (•)𝑈 †,⊗𝑘 ], equals the 𝑘-th moment of the Haar ensemble on 𝑈 (2 𝑛 ): Φ ℰ = Φ 𝐻 . While exact designs provide the strongest possible guarantees, efficient realizations beyond 𝑘 ≤ 3 are exceedingly rare.",
        "To address this limitation, several notions of approximate unitary 𝑘-designs have been introduced. We begin with the strongest such notion, the so-called relative error [32]. A unitary ensemble ℰ is an approximate unitary 𝑘-design with relative error 𝜀 if its moment obeys (1 -𝜀)Φ 𝐻 ⪯ Φ ℰ ⪯ (1 + 𝜀)Φ 𝐻 , where 𝒜 ⪯ ℬ indicates that ℬ -𝒜 is a completely positive map. Physically, the relative error guarantees that a random unitary 𝑈 ∼ ℰ cannot be distinguished from Haar-random in any quantum experiment that queries it up to 𝑘 times [36]. It also provides even stronger guarantees on properties that cannot be efficiently measured in any quantum experiment [39].",
        "Remarkably, unitary 𝑘-designs with relative error 𝜀 over 𝑛 qubits can form in extremely low circuit depths of Õ(𝑘 log 𝑛/𝜀) [35,36], growing only logarithmically in the number of qubits 𝑛. This holds even in one-dimensional systems with small light-cones. The dependence on 𝑛, 𝑘, and 𝜀 was further improved exponentially to 𝒪(𝑘 log 𝑘•log log(𝑛/𝜀)), to achieve relative error, and 𝒪(log 𝑘•log log(𝑛/𝜀)), to achieve a more physical notion of measurable error, for systems with long-range two-qubit gates [39].",
        "The existence of such low-depth unitary designs is counter-intuitive, as they appear to capture many features of Haar-random unitaries [35,36] without developing other characteristic features such as large light-cones, high entanglement, decay of out-of-time-order correlations, and good quantum encoding properties. Notably, these latter features are precisely the standard diagnostics of quantum information scrambling in many-body quantum physics and quantum gravity [15,20,25,26,[51][52][53][54][55][56].",
        "A resolution to this apparent paradox was provided in [36]: these scrambling-related features cannot be detected efficiently in any quantum experiment that queries only the forward evolution 𝑈 . Consequently, they do not form barriers to realizing low-depth unitary designs. However, many scrambling diagnostics can be efficiently detected in quantum experiments that involve the inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 of the unitary 𝑈 . These are precisely the experiments traditionally studied in quantum information scrambling [10,54,[57][58][59][60][61]. For example, estimating out-of-timeorder correlators to study butterfly effects requires time-reversal operations 𝑈 † [54,57,57], while the decoding protocol for the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment involves complex conjugation 𝑈 * [45]. This motivates a stronger notion of approximate unitary designs that captures experiments involving not just 𝑈 , but also 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , and 𝑈 𝑇 .",
        "Strong unitary designs. We define a strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 𝑘-design as any random unitary ensemble ℰ that cannot be distinguished from Haar-random in any quantum experiment that makes any 𝑘 queries to the unitary 𝑈 or its inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 . To be precise, if we denote the output of a general quantum experiment as",
        ", where each ∘ 𝑗 ∈ {•, †, 𝑇, *} represents forward evolution, inverse, transpose, or conjugate respectively, and 𝑊 𝑗 are arbitrary quantum operations applied between successive queries, then we demand",
        "for all choices of 𝑊 𝑗 and ∘ 𝑗 . This generalizes the notion of adaptive security for pseudorandom unitaries [11,42] and measurable error for unitary designs [39] to incorporate all variants of the unitary. We refer to Appendix A.1 for further discussion, including strong versions of other design approximation metrics. With this definition, a fundamental question arises: what circuit depths are required for strong unitary designs to form? A basic light-cone argument, which we formalize later, shows that strong unitary designs cannot form until information can propagate between any pair of qubits in the system. This requires the light-cone of the evolution to encompass all 𝑛 qubits, demanding depth Ω(log 𝑛) in general quantum circuits and dynamics. Can this extremely fast speed of scrambling actually be achieved? The fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics posits that all-to-all connected quantum systems can achieve logarithmic scrambling times [20]. However, existing progress toward proving this conjecture has focused on specific scrambling diagnostics, such as the decay of out-oftime-order correlators or the encoding properties of random unitaries [26,[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71]. A fully general operational proof of this conjecture has remained an open question.",
        "Our main result establishes that strong unitary designs can indeed form in optimal circuit depth 𝒪(log 𝑛) in all-to-all-connected architectures. This proves that every property of a random unitary measurable in a constant number of queries scrambles in logarithmic time.",

        "For all-to-all random circuits consisting of independent Haar-random two-qubit gates without ancilla qubits, 𝑑 = 𝒪(𝑘 • poly log 𝑘 • log(𝑛/𝜀) + log 𝑛 • log(𝑛/𝜀)).",
        "The structured circuits achieve the optimal 𝒪(log 𝑛) scaling in system size when 𝑘 and 𝜀 are held constant, while the random circuits achieve an 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) scaling. The upper bounds for structured circuits are nearly optimal across all parameters, as confirmed by our lower bounds:",
        "Proposition 1. (Depth lower bounds for strong unitary designs) For any 𝜀 < 1/4, any circuit ensemble over 𝑛 qubits that forms a strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 𝑘-design requires circuit depth 𝑑:",
        "for any all-to-all circuits with any number of ancilla qubits.",
        "2. 𝑑 = Ω (︀ log 𝑛 + 𝑘/ log(𝑛𝑘) )︀ for any all-to-all circuits with at most 𝒪(𝑛) ancilla qubits.",
        "In contrast, for any 1D circuits with any number of ancilla qubits, 𝑑 = Ω (︀ 𝑛 + 𝑘/ log(𝑛𝑘) )︀ .",

We provide detailed constructions and proof techniques in Section 4 and complete proofs in Appendix A.

        "Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) seek to mimic Haar-random unitaries in efficient quantum experiments. Let us first review their standard definition and then provide our strong definition and summarize our main results on strong PRUs.",
        "Background. A random unitary ensemble ℰ is a PRU if no efficient quantum algorithm can distinguish a random unitary 𝑈 ∼ ℰ from a Haar-random unitary under polynomially many queries to 𝑈 [11]. More precisely, ℰ is a PRU with security against any 𝑡(𝑛)-time quantum adversary if it cannot be distinguished from Haar-random in any 𝑡(𝑛)-time quantum experiment, where 𝑡(𝑛) is some function of the number of qubits 𝑛.",
        "The premier example is the Permutation-Function-Clifford (PFC) ensemble [40], 𝑈 = 𝑃 𝐹 𝐶, formed by multiplying a pseudorandom permutation 𝑃 , a pseudorandom function 𝐹 , and a random Clifford unitary 𝐶. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, the PFC ensemble achieves security against subexponential-time quantum adversaries [42]. However, it requires circuit depth poly(𝑛) to implement, even on all-to-all-connected geometries, due to the circuit depth of the pseudorandom permutation [36,73]. To further reduce these depths, we consider a glued construction, with two layers of small 2𝜉-qubit random unitaries (various colors) sandwiched between strong 𝑛qubit unitary 2-designs (green). This forms a strong unitary 𝑘-design when 𝜉 = Ω(log(𝑛𝑘/𝜀)) and a strong PRU when 𝜉 = 𝜔(log 𝑛). We instantiate each small unitary with the LRFC ensemble. (c) To obtain ancilla-free constructions, we replace each 𝑛-qubit 2-design with a fast scrambling circuit of depth log 𝑛 composed of 2𝜉-qubit 2-designs. For ancilla-free strong unitary designs consisting of Haar-random two-qubit gates, each small unitary is drawn from a random circuit on 2𝜉 qubits. For ancilla-free strong PRUs, each small unitary is implemented by reusing neighboring qubits as ancillae.",
        "Recent work has achieved exponential improvements in the circuit depths of standard PRUs. Ref. [36] reduces the depth to poly(log 𝑛) while maintaining security against polynomial-time quantum adversaries. The same work also discusses PRU realizations in even smaller circuit depths poly(log log 𝑛) using the LRFC ensemble introduced in our work. 3 We will show that the LRFC ensemble forms a strong PRU in circuit depth poly(log 𝑛), which yields circuit depth poly(log log 𝑛) for the two-layer LRFC ensemble considered in Ref. [36].",
        "Similar to standard unitary designs, existing PRUs exhibit a fundamental limitation: they only guarantee security against experiments that query the forward evolution 𝑈 . However, as discussed for strong unitary designs, many important quantum phenomena require experiments involving the inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 to be detected. Prior work partially addressed this by extending the PFC ensemble to achieve security against experiments querying both 𝑈 and 𝑈 † , using the construction 𝑈 = 𝐷𝑃 𝐹 𝐶 with an additional random Clifford 𝐷 [42]. However, this approach still omits conjugate and transpose operations, and requires poly(𝑛) circuit depth to implement. In our results that follow, we establish security under all queries to 𝑈, 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 and exponentially reduce the circuit depth from poly(𝑛) to 𝒪(log 𝑛).",

        "We describe our constructions and proof methods in Section 4 and provide a complete proof in Appendix B and Appendix E. The first result utilizes our LRFC ensemble [Fig. 2(a)] combined with our gluing theorem for strong random unitaries [Fig. 2(b)]. A circuit depth lower bound of Ω(log 𝑛) can be easily proven by noting that if the depth of 𝑈 is sublinear in log 𝑛, then an experiment that measures 𝑈 † 𝑋 1 𝑈 |0 𝑛 ⟩ in the all 𝑍 basis will result in a bitstring with almost all zeros, whereas a Haar-random unitary 𝑈 will result in a bitstring with almost equal number of zeros and ones. Hence, the achieved 𝑑 = 𝒪(log 𝑛) scaling is optimal. The second result combines the LRFC ensemble, our gluing theorem, and a new strategy for compiling random classical functions in quantum circuits and gluing them together by reusing system qubits on other local patches as ancilla qubits. Both results rely only on the subexponential hardness of standard learning with errors (LWE) [48].

This replacement leads to an exponential improvement in circuit depth, since known constructions of quantum-secure pseudorandom functions [74] are much more efficient than those of pseudorandom permutations [73]. The random shuffle gates are inspired by the Luby-Rackoff block cipher in classical cryptography [75].

To construct strong unitary 𝑘-designs, we will replace each random function with an exact 2𝑘-wise independent function [76]. This replicates the first 2𝑘 moments of a random function, which guarantees that any quantum experiment making 𝑘 queries will proceed identically to if the function was random. The factor of two accounts for the bra and ket of the quantum state. Exact 2𝑘-wise independent functions can be implemented in quantum circuit depth 𝒪(𝑘 • log 𝑛) using Õ(𝑛) ancilla qubits, or depth 𝒪(log 𝑘 • log 𝑛) using Õ(𝑛𝑘) ancilla qubits [39].

Intuitively, the larger 2-designs scramble the input to the strong random unitaries, which guarantees that the overlap of the input state with counter-examples to the strong gluing construction is exceedingly small.

This demonstrates that the fast formation of strong random unitaries is possible even in highly unstructured ensembles, complementing our highly structured implementations thus far. This generality is not trivial; for example, standard unitary designs can be implemented in circuit depth 𝒪(log log 𝑛) in highly structured unitary ensembles, but require depth Ω(log 𝑛) in local random circuits on any architecture [36,39,80].",
        "Our random circuit construction builds upon the scrambled two-layer ensemble introduced in the previous section [Fig. 2(c)]. We modify the ensemble in two ways to enable a random circuit realization. First, we replace both of the 𝑛-qubit unitary 2-designs with blocked fast scrambling circuits, composed of small unitary 2-designs acting on 2𝜉 qubits each. The small unitary 2-designs are arranged such that the 𝑖-th patch of qubits is coupled to the (𝑖 + 2 𝑑-1 )-patch of qubits at the 𝑑-th circuit layer. This guarantees that the light-cone of every qubit doubles at every circuit layer, so that every light-cone encompasses all 𝑛 qubits after log 2 (𝑛/𝜉) layers. Second, we replace all of the small random unitaries in the ensemble with 1D local random circuits [32]. We specify the depths of these circuits below. The circuit is highly unstructured, in the sense that each two-qubit gate is drawn independently at random from the Haar measure on 𝑈 (4).",

Then the blocked fast scrambling circuit forms a strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 2-design with depth 𝑑 log 2 (𝑛/𝜉) for any 𝜉 ≥ log 2 (5𝑛/𝜀).",

Setting 𝜉 = 𝒪(log 𝑛𝑘/𝜀) as in Theorem 5 yields a total circuit depth of 𝒪(𝑘•poly log 𝑘•log 𝑛/𝜀+log 𝑛•log 𝑛𝑘/𝜀).",
        "The proofs of Lemma 2 and Lemma 3 are contained in Appendix D.2 and A.4, respectively. We prove Lemma 2 by establishing a formal connection between operator spreading and strong unitary 2-designs. Operator spreading refers to the growth in support of initially local operators under a quantum circuit or time dynamics; this signifies the scrambling of local information into non-local correlations [25,26,52]. In random circuits, this growth is probabilistic and is characterized by a probability distribution over the set of Pauli strings [55]. We show that an ensemble forms a strong  [21]. This follows because the decoding protocol uses the conjugate random unitary [45]. (c) In a strong unitary 4-design or strong pseudorandom unitary, the operator size distribution approaches its Haar-random value to within small total variational distance. unitary 2-design if and only if its operator spreading distributions are close to those of a Haar-random unitary. To establish that the blocked fast scrambling circuit satisfies this condition, we prove that with high probability every operator is randomly supported within its light-cone at every layer.",
        "The statement of Lemma 3 for strong unitary designs closely parallels an analogous statement for standard unitary designs [34]. These statements are derived by translating lower bounds on the spectral gap of random circuits to upper bounds on their design depth [32]. This translation involves several steps: One first uses the spectral gap to bound the so-called additive error of a unitary design, and then translates the additive error to a bound on the relative error. For standard unitary designs, this translation can either be proven using the Schur-Weyl duality [32] or from elementary properties of the permutation operators [36]. In Appendix A.1, we provide an analogous additive-to-relativeerror translation result for strong unitary designs. Our analysis yields numerous insights into the structure of the mixed Haar twirl, which may be useful in other contexts. For example, we formalize the following statement: Within any quantum experiment, a Haar-random unitary 𝑈 and its inverse 𝑈 † either cancel one another, or behave identically to two independent random unitaries 𝑈 and 𝑉 ."

        "We now elaborate on the connections between our results and fast quantum information scrambling. Quantum information scrambling is a broad field focused on understanding the spreading of quantum information in dynamical many-body quantum systems. As discussed in detail in our introduction, the fast scrambling conjecture [20] posits that (i) all-to-all-connected quantum systems can scramble information in time growing only logarithmically in the system size 𝑛, and (ii) this is the fastest that any quantum system can scramble information.",
        "Our construction of strong unitary 𝑘-designs and strong pseudorandom unitaries in 𝒪(log 𝑛) circuit depth provides the strongest confirmation to date of the fast scrambling conjecture. These results prove that every observable feature of unitary quantum dynamics can mimic Haar-random behavior in logarithmic depth. This significantly expands upon existing works, which, as aforementioned, focus on either a small number of specific signatures or solely unitary 2-design properties [26,[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71]. Meanwhile, our lower bound, which is simple to derive, confirms that a logarithmic depth is optimal for any unitary to appear Haar-random in experiments that involve the inverse or conjugate.",
        "We illustrate the connection between strong unitary designs and strong PRUs and quantum information scrambling in more detail through several examples (Fig. 4). We consider four hallmark diagnostics of quantum information scrambling: (a) the decay of all local time-ordered and outof-time-order correlation functions [25], (b) the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment [21], (c) the saturation of operator size distributions to their Haar-random profile [26], and (d) the growth of the entanglement and operator entanglement entropies. The implications of our results for each behavior follow straightforwardly from our definitions of strong unitary 𝑘-designs and strong PRUs. We discuss this example-by-example below.",
        "Decay of all out-of-time-order correlation functions. Perhaps the simplest diagnostic of scrambling is the decay of all local correlation functions to zero [53]. This includes both conventional time-ordered correlations functions (TOCs), as well as out-of-time-order correlations functions (OTOCs) [25]. The former can be measured with forward time-evolution under 𝑈 . Crucially however, the latter can only be efficiently measured by alternating forward and backward time-evolution under 𝑈 and 𝑈 † [Fig. 4(a)]. In Appendix G, we provide a short proof that all local 𝑘-point correlation functions are near zero with high probability in any strong unitary 2𝑘-design. A similar statement holds for strong PRUs. This complements existing observations that OTOCs can decay in logarithmic time in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model [62,63] and all-to-all-connected random circuits [24,56]. Our results capture both standard four-point OTOCs as well as higher-point OTOCs, which have risen in interest in recent work [10,[81][82][83][84].",
        "Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. A key inspiration for early studies of quantum information scrambling came from the black hole information paradox [85]. In this context, Hayden and Preskill proposed that, if one models the dynamics of a black hole by a random unitary, then one could use the Hawking radiation collected from a black hole to recover a quantum state that fell into the black hole at an earlier time [21]. An explicit decoding protocol was later provided by Yoshida and Kitaev [45]. Crucially, the decoding protocol utilizes the conjugate random unitary 𝑈 * [Fig. 4(b)]. Thus, any strong unitary 2-design or strong pseudorandom unitary will encode information precisely as well as a Haar-random unitary in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment 6 . Intriguingly, this result does not seem to extend to all applications of Haar-random unitaries as quantum codes; in particular, it applies only when the decoding can be performed efficiently using query access to 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 .",
        "Growth of operator size distributions. An even more fine-grained diagnostic of quantum information scrambling is the operator size distribution [26]. The size distribution characterizes the support of a time-evolved operator when expanded in the Pauli basis, 𝑂(𝑡)",
        ", where the sum is over all Pauli operators of weight (i.e. size) 𝒮. Operator size distributions and are central to applications of information scrambling in quantum gravity [22][23][24]26], quantum sensing [86], and understanding the impact of noise on quantum systems [47,56,60]. In Appendix G, we prove that the operator size distribution of any strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 4-design is 𝑛 2 𝜀-close to its Haar-random value in total variational distance. Setting 𝜀 = 1/𝜔(poly 𝑛) yields operator size distributions that are super-polynomially close to their Haar values in circuit depth 𝒪(log 𝑛).",
        "Entanglement and operator entanglement entropy. Finally, we consider the entanglement and operator entanglement entropies. In principle, neither of these quantities can be efficiently measured in any quantum experiment. Therefore their values in a Haar-random state need not be replicated by approximate strong unitary designs or strong PRUs. Nonetheless, in Appendix G, we show that an especially precise form of strong unitary designs, characterized by a small relative error, can efficiently capture the entanglement and operator entanglement entropies. In Appendix C, we show that such designs can be formed in 𝒪(log 𝑛) circuit depth. From this, we find that the Renyi-2 entanglement entropy of any subsystem of any time-evolved state |𝜓(𝑡)⟩ ≡ 𝑈 |𝜓⟩ reaches its Haar-random value in 𝒪(log 𝑛) depth. In addition, the Renyi-2 operator entanglement entropy of any subsystem of any time-evolved operator 𝑂(𝑡) ≡ 𝑈 𝑂𝑈 † reaches its Haar-random value in 𝒪(log 𝑛) depth. Formally, these bounds are achieved by reformulating each entropy as the expectation value of a positive-valued operator after 𝑈 and 𝑈 * are applied to a fictitious larger system."

Our ancilla-free constructions address a fundamental limitation of previous PRU constructions, which relied on auxiliary systems that are unrealistic in physical settings. This advance opens a deeper question: can we build upon ancillafree strong random unitaries to demonstrate that dynamics naturally arising in condensed matter, quantum chaos, and high-energy physics form strong random unitaries?",

Can the circuit depth of our local random circuit construction of strong unitary designs be further improved, from 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) to 𝒪(log 𝑛)? In particular, our treatment of the blocked fast scrambling circuit is extremely coarse and likely leaves room for an improved analysis. Along similar lines, can one further remove the structure from our random circuit designs, and prove the fast formation of strong unitary designs in the standard model of all-to-all random circuits [64][65][66]? More broadly, can our refined techniques for analyzing the mixed-unitary twirl [87][88][89]"

We then introduce our definitions to resolve this.",
        "Weakness of standard definitions of approximate unitary designs. We can illustrate the weakness of standard definitions of approximate unitary designs with two examples. The examples involve experiments that perform one query to 𝑈 and one query to either the inverse or the conjugate. We show that both experiments can easily distinguish any low-depth unitary from Haar-random. Since low-depth circuits can form relative error unitary designs, this implies that such designs are not sufficient for bounding properties of such experiments. At a formal level, the translation from the relative error to the trace-norm error in the output of an experiment querying the inverse or conjugate incurs an exponential factor of 2 𝑛 , which ruins the error bound when the number of qubits 𝑛 is large. Our first and simplest example involves the inverse unitary [93,94]. Consider a quantum experiment that prepares the zero state on all qubits, scrambles the system via 𝑈 , then applies a Pauli operator 𝑋 1 on the first qubit, then attempts to un-scramble the system via 𝑈 † . If 𝑈 is Haar-random, the Pauli perturbation completely disrupts the time-reversal, resulting in an effectively Haar-random state after 𝑈 † is applied. On the other hand, if 𝑈 is low-depth, all qubits outside of the light-cone of Figure 5: Reformulation of any quantum experiment that makes any 𝑘 queries to 𝑈 , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 , or 𝑈 † as an alternative experiment that makes a single query to 𝑈 ⊗𝑝 ⊗ 𝑈 *,⊗𝑞 and performs 𝑘 post-selections on 𝑛-qubit Bell states. Here, 𝑝 counts the number of applications of 𝑈 and 𝑈 𝑇 and 𝑞 counts the number of applications of 𝑈 * and 𝑈 † . The subsystem labels match the notation used in our proofs based on the path-recording framework (Appendix D. 1 andC).",

Consider an experiment that prepars the EPR state between two copies of 𝑛 qubits, applies a Pauli operator 𝑋 1 on the first qubit of the left side, then applies 𝑈 and 𝑈 * in parallel to the left and right side. This yields the state",

This implies that the fidelity for any pair of qubits between the left and right side to be in the EPR state is close to its maximally mixed value, 1/4 On the other hand, when 𝑈 is low depth, the operator 𝑈 𝑋 1 𝑈 † has support only on a small light-cone around the first qubit. Thus, the fidelity of e.g. the last pair of qubits to remain in the EPR state is equal to 1. Hence, one can again easily distinguish any low-depth unitary from Haar-random.",

While this formula is simple to write down, it provides fairly little intuition about the properties and behavior of the mixed Haar twirl. We begin this section by reformulating this expression in a more intuitive manner. We will then derive our approximate expression for the mixed Haar twirl from this reformulation. For brevity, we defer the proofs of several facts stated in our reformulation of the mixed Haar twirl to the later Appendix F. The proofs are straightforward but require many detailed steps.",
        "Unlike the permutation operators, which appear in the standard Haar twirl, the partially transposed permutations are not necessarily unitary. Indeed, a key role in the mixed Haar twirl is played by a subset of partially transposed permutations that are projectors. Consider any permutation 𝜋 that is equal to a tensor product of (i) identity elements, and (ii) swap operations between a copy on the left side and a copy on the right side. Here, the \"left side\" corresponds to the 𝑝 copies that 𝑈 acts on, and the \"right side\" to the 𝑞 copies that 𝑈 * acts on. When 𝜋 is partially transposed, it results in a permutation 𝜎 = 𝜋 Γ that is a tensor product of (i) identity elements, and (ii) EPR projectors between a copy on the left side and a copy on the right side. This follows because the partial transpose of a swap operator is proportional to an EPR projector, 𝒮 Γ 𝑖𝑗 = 2 𝑛 𝑃 EPR,𝑖𝑗 for copies 𝑖, 𝑗. If we label the set of pairs between the left and right side as 𝛼 𝜎 = {(𝑖 1 , 𝑗 1 ), (𝑖 2 , 𝑗 2 ), . . . , (𝑖 |𝛼𝜎| , 𝑗 |𝛼𝜎| )}, then 𝑃 𝛼𝜎 ≡ 𝜎/2 𝑛|𝛼𝜎| projects onto EPR states on every pair in 𝛼 𝜎 and acts trivially on the remaining copies.",

        ")︀ ℓ! ways to place the ℓ EPR pairs, which are indexed by the subsystem 𝒜 ℓ . Once placed, the remaining 𝑝 -ℓ and 𝑞 -ℓ copies are free to be in any quantum state that has zero EPR pairs between the left and right. We provide a detailed derivation of Eq. (A.18) in Appendix F using only basic properties of the partially transposed permutations.",
        "A crucial property of the EPR state is that it is invariant under the action of 𝑈 ⊗ 𝑈 * for any 𝑈 .",
        "This follows because (𝑈 ⊗ 1)𝑃 EPR = (1 ⊗ 𝑈 𝑇 )𝑃 EPR and 𝑈 * 𝑈 𝑇 = 1. Hence, when a mixed unitary (𝑈 ) ⊗𝑝 ⊗ (𝑈 * ) ⊗𝑞 is applied to a subspace with exactly ℓ EPR pairs, its action on each of the ℓ EPR pairs becomes trivial. This leaves 𝑝-ℓ copies of 𝑈 and 𝑞 -ℓ copies of 𝑈 * remaining. To formalize this, for each value of ℓ we define a partial isometry Ĩℓ (see Appendix F for details) that maps each ℓ-EPR subspace ℋ ⊗𝑝 ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞 to the ℓ-th Hilbert space on the right side of Eq. (A.18). The partial isometries provide an orthogonal decomposition of the full Hilbert space, 1 = ∑︀ ℓ Ĩ † ℓ Ĩℓ , where each Ĩ † ℓ Ĩℓ projects onto the subspace of exactly ℓ EPR pairs.

(A. 19) by the product of identity matrices, (1/𝐷 𝑝-ℓ )𝛿 𝜋 𝐿 ,π 𝐿 and (1/𝐷 𝑞-ℓ )𝛿 𝜋 𝑅 ,π 𝑅 . We provide a proof of the lemma in Appendix A.2.3, In addition to its technical convenience, the approximate mixed Haar twirl provides an intuitive picture for the behavior of random unitaries in experiments involving time-reversal. Consider a quantum experiment querying 𝑈 and 𝑈 † (or 𝑈 * or 𝑈 𝑇 ) many times. First, within the experiment, some subset of the applications of 𝑈 might cancel with applications of 𝑈 † (or 𝑈 * , etc.). The number of cancellations corresponds to the ℓ in our earlier discussion, and the pairing of the cancellations corresponds to the register 𝒜 ℓ . In principle, a quantum experiment could be a superposition of many different pairings, hence 𝒜 ℓ is a quantum register. Then, among the un-cancelled applications, 𝑈 and 𝑈 † behave indistinguishably from two independent random unitaries 𝑈 and 𝑉 . This is the statement of Lemma 8: After pulling 𝑈 and 𝑈 * inside the partial isometry, their twirl is equal to the tensor product of two standard Haar twirls Φ (𝑝-ℓ) 𝑎 and Φ (𝑞-ℓ) 𝑎 up to small relative error. So the behavior of time-reversal experiments is in some sense very simple: 𝑈 and 𝑈 † either cancel or they act completely independently. The function of the original Weingarten matrix elements and the ensuing partial isometries is solely to keep track of all the different ways that 𝑈 and 𝑈 † might cancel."

Here, we only need to glue 2𝑚 unitaries together in order to realize a standard design via Lemma 3 of Ref. [36]; hence, we only pick up an additional error linear in 𝑚, instead of 𝑚 log 2 𝑚. Thus, the blocked fast scrambling circuit has measurable error at most 8𝑚/2 𝜉 + 𝑚𝜀/𝑛 in any of these eight experiments. Setting 𝜉 ≥ min(log 2 (3𝑛/𝜀), 4) yields an error less than 𝜀.",
        "Let us now turn to the remaining eight experiments, which query one of 𝑈, 𝑈 𝑇 and one of 𝑈 * , 𝑈 † . We will leverage Proposition 2 to bound the measurable error. To begin, we consider the blocked fast scrambling circuit in which each small unitary is Haar-random. Let 𝑃 be any Pauli operator. When a Pauli operator is acted on by a small random unitary within its support, the resulting Pauli operator has support on both patches of the small random unitary with probability 1 -",
        "where the latter term counts the fraction of non-identity Pauli operators on 2𝜉 qubits that have support on only a single patch. Consider any single patch in the support of 𝑃 , and all the small random unitaries within the light-cone of the patch. There are at most 1 + 2 + 4 + • • • + 𝑚 = 2𝑚 -1 such unitaries. Therefore, the probability that every small random unitary in the light-cone spreads the Pauli operator to both patches in its support is at least 1 -(2𝑚 -1)(2/4 𝜉 ). The probability that the time-evolved operator 𝑈 𝑃 𝑈 † has support on every patch of 𝜉 qubits is hence at least this value. We denote this probability as 1 -𝛿 ℰ , with 𝛿 ℰ ≤ 4𝑚/4 𝜉 .",
        "Let us now turn to the action of an 𝑛-qubit Haar-random unitary. Under an 𝑛-qubit Haar-random unitary, the time-evolved operator 𝑈 𝑃 𝑈 † is drawn from the flat distribution on the set of 4 𝑛 -1 non-identity Pauli operators. Therefore, it has support on every patch of 𝜉 qubits with probability",
        "The probability distributions 𝑝 ℰ (𝑃, 𝑄) and 𝑝 𝐻 (𝑃, 𝑄) are both flat among the Pauli operators 𝑄 that have support on every patch of 𝜉 qubits, since both ℰ and 𝐻 are invariant under composition with small random unitaries on each patch. The TVD between the two distributions picks up contributions from two sources. The 𝑄 with full support contribute a factor of |𝛿 𝐻 -𝛿 ℰ | ≤ 𝛿 𝐻 + 𝛿 ℰ , proportional to the difference in the flat value of 𝑝 ℰ (𝑃, 𝑄) and 𝑝 𝐻 (𝑃, 𝑄) on such 𝑄. Meanwhile, the other 𝑄 contribute at most a factor of 𝛿 𝐻 + 𝛿 ℰ , since the two distributions have at most this support on such operators. Thus, the TVD between the two distributions is less than, A.4 Proof of Lemma 3: Strong unitary 𝑘-designs from 1D random circuits",
        "In this section, we provide our proof that one-dimensional local random circuits form strong unitary 𝑘-designs with small relative error in linear depth (Theorem 3 of the main text). Our proof follows the same approach used to show that 1D random circuits form standard unitary designs [32]. This is enabled by our new Lemma 7 which allows one to translate from spectral gaps [32,34,72] to relative error strong unitary designs.",
        "Let us first review a few of the key definitions used in the spectral gap literature [32,34,98]. The central object studied in these works is the so-called moment operator,",

        "𝐻 is defined with respect to the standard twirl [32]. This allows one to bound the relative error via Lemma 6. In what follows, we show that this approach proceeds identically for strong unitary designs after replacing Lemma 6 with our Lemma 7.",
        "and 𝑝 + 𝑞 = 𝑘. The relationship between the essential norm and the spectral norm when 𝛿Φ is applied to a state follows from a straightforward series of equalities,",
        "where |𝜌⟩ denotes the vectorization of 𝜌. Hence, an upper bound on the essential norm immediately translates to an identical upper bound on the spectral norm of 𝛿Φ(𝜌) for any state 𝜌. The two inequalities are saturated when 𝜌 is pure and equal to the extremal eigenvector of 𝛿𝑀 . In previous works, the equalities above are applied when 𝛿Φ is defined with respect to the standard twirl [32]. In this case, the 𝑘 copies of 𝑈 in 𝛿𝑀 act on the left (\"ket\") side of the vectorization of 𝜌, and the 𝑘 copies of 𝑈 * act on the right (\"bra\") side. However, an identical bound holds for the mixed twirl as well. In this case, we have 𝑝 copies of 𝑈 and 𝑞 copies of 𝑈 * that act on the left side of the vectorization of 𝜌, and 𝑞 copies of 𝑈 and 𝑝 copies of 𝑈 * that act on the right side. Since there 𝑘 copies of both 𝑈 and 𝑈 * in total, the remaining steps proceed identically regardless of the value of 𝑝, 𝑞.",

    "Understanding how fast a quantum system can scramble information is a fundamental question with implications throughout quantum science. In quantum computing, quantum information scrambling by random circuits enables efficient device benchmarking [1][2][3][4], quantum state tomography [5][6][7], and quantum advantage demonstrations [8][9][10]. In quantum cryptography [11][12][13], scrambling is characterized by the computational indistinguishability of quantum circuits from Haar-random unitaries, and enables new cryptographically secure protocols. In fundamental physics, scrambling and the emergence of Haar-random unitary behaviors provide powerful theoretical tools for modeling complex phenomena across diverse areas, from quantum many-body dynamics [14][15][16] to quantum chaos and thermalization [17][18][19] to quantum gravity and black hole physics [20][21][22][23][24].",
    "Across all of these contexts, a central question concerns the minimum time required to scramble quantum information. This question is crucial for quantum technologies: the shorter the time required, the more experimentally applicable random unitary protocols become. In physics, this question is captured by the fast scrambling conjecture, proposed by Sekino and Susskind [20], which states1 : Conjecture 1 (Fast scrambling conjecture, Sekino and Susskind [20]). The minimum time to scramble information in quantum systems of 𝑛 qubits under all-to-all connectivity is Θ(log 𝑛).",
    "In their original formulation, scrambling was characterized through entanglement growth: for every 𝑛-qubit pure state |𝜓⟩, every sufficiently small subsystem of the time-evolved state 𝑈 |𝜓⟩⟨𝜓| 𝑈 † should achieve near-maximal entanglement entropy in 𝒪(log 𝑛) time. However, the modern physical understanding of quantum information scrambling encompasses numerous signatures beyond entanglement growth, including, in physical studies, the decay of out-of-time-order correlators [25], information recovery protocols like the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment [21], and the saturation of operator size distributions and operator entanglement entropies to their Haar-random values [26].",
    "In recent years, indistinguishability from Haar-random has emerged as a powerful conceptual framework for characterizing scrambling: a system scrambles if its dynamics 𝑈 become operationally indistinguishable from Haar-random evolution in any physical experiment. Operational indistinguishability is commonly defined through approximate unitary 𝑘-designs [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) [11,[40][41][42]. The former guarantees that 𝑈 is indistinguishable from a Haar-random unitary within any quantum experiment that queries 𝑈 up to 𝑘 times, while the latter concerns any polynomial-time quantum experiment. These general operational frameworks offer a crucial advantage of also capturing any future scrambling diagnostics yet to be discovered. This naturally motivates the following operational formulation of the fast scrambling conjecture:",
    "Conjecture 2 (Operational fast scrambling conjecture). The minimum circuit depth to form 𝑛-qubit unitary 𝑘-designs (for constant 𝑘) and PRUs under all-to-all connectivity is Θ(log 𝑛).",
    "The past decade has seen remarkable progress in understanding the depths needed to form unitary designs and PRUs [11,[32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]. Unfortunately, standard notions of designs and PRUs possess two critical limitations, which undermine the utility of the fast scrambling conjecture formulated above.",
    "Limitation 1: Forward-only access. Standard unitary designs and PRUs only guarantee indistinguishability under forward queries to 𝑈 . However, many scrambling diagnostics require access to the inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 operations. For example, out-of-time-order correlators require time-reversal operations using 𝑈 † to be efficiently measured [44], while efficient information recovery in the Hayden-Preskill protocol requires complex conjugation 𝑈 * [45]. Similarly, recent work in quantum cryptography [46] suggests that the strongest notion of PRUs should allow access to all of 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 (as well as their controlled versions), reflecting the fact that a user with knowledge of the gates composing 𝑈 should be able to implement all these transformations.",
    "Standard designs and PRUs fail to capture these essential features. In fact, they do not even satisfy an Ω(log 𝑛) depth lower bound: recent work [39,47] shows that standard unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in Θ(log log 𝑛) depth, exponentially faster than the conjectured minimum scrambling time of Θ(log 𝑛). This demonstrates that forward-only indistinguishability is insufficient to capture the complete range of scrambling behaviors often desired in physics and cryptography.",
    "Limitation 2: Unphysical use of ancillary systems. All existing PRU constructions [36,40,42] over 𝑛 qubits require 𝑚 = poly(𝑛) ancilla qubits initialized to |0 𝑚 ⟩ and returned to |0 𝑚 ⟩ to achieve pseudorandomness on the original 𝑛 qubits. While this use of ancilla qubits is acceptable for cryptographic applications, it creates a fundamental mismatch when modeling physical quantum dynamics. Physical scrambling processes, whether in black holes or many-body quantum systems, operate on fixed Hilbert spaces and do not involve auxiliary degrees of freedom with fine-tuned initialization and finalization conditions. As a result, standard cryptographic PRUs do not necessarily provide appropriate evidence for physical scrambling processes.",
    "In this work, we address both of these limitations. First, we introduce strong unitary 𝑘-designs and strong pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), which are indistinguishable from Haar-random in any experiment that queries the unitary 𝑈 or its inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 . Second, we initiate the study of ancilla-free PRUs, which are PRUs with efficient ancilla-free circuit implementations. These definitions motivate a strengthened version of the fast scrambling conjecture: Conjecture 3 (Strong fast scrambling conjecture). The minimum depth to form 𝑛-qubit strong unitary designs and PRUs under all-to-all connectivity is Θ(log 𝑛), achievable without ancilla. This conjecture captures the strongest possible operational meaning of fast scrambling: quantum dynamics that remain indistinguishable from Haar-random under any efficient quantum experiment involving any combination of operations, realized using only the physical degrees of freedom.",
    "Our main results provide compelling evidence for, and an almost full resolution to, the strong fast scrambling conjecture:",
    "1. Strong unitary designs. We provide the first proof of existence for strong unitary designs and establish that the minimum depth to form them is precisely Θ(log 𝑛). This proves that every property measurable in finitely many queries scrambles in logarithmic time.",
    "2. Strong PRUs. We provide the first proof of existence for strong PRUs secure against all operations 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 and establish that the minimum depth to form them is precisely Θ(log 𝑛) under a well-established cryptographic assumption: subexponential hardness of learning with errors (LWE) [48]. This represents a significant advance over prior work [42], which requires poly(𝑛) depth and only achieved security against 𝑈 and 𝑈 † . Our result proves that every property measurable by polynomial-time experiments scrambles in logarithmic time.",
    "3. Ancilla-free constructions: We show that both strong unitary designs and strong PRUs can be implemented without using any ancilla qubits in poly(log 𝑛) depth. While slightly larger than the conjectured Θ(log 𝑛), this provides the first ancilla-free PRU construction for any security notion, including standard forward-only PRUs. These constructions are secure under the subexponential hardness2 of learning with errors [48].",
    "4. Generic emergence. We prove that all-to-all random circuits consisting of independent Haarrandom two-qubit gates form strong unitary designs in 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) depth, providing evidence that fast scrambling is a generic phenomenon rather than requiring careful engineering.",
    "All of our results immediately extend to quantum experiments with access to controlled versions of 𝑈, 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 , following the general reduction laid out in [49,50]. Our constructions of strong unitary designs and strong PRUs introduce several new random unitary ensembles and techniques for working with strong random unitaries. Our main technical contributions are threefold. First, we introduce the Luby-Rackoff-Function-Clifford (LRFC) ensemble and prove that it forms both strong unitary designs and strong PRUs. The LRFC ensemble adapts the Permutation-Function-Clifford (PFC) ensemble of [40], replacing the random permutation with a Luby-Rackoff construction to achieve exponentially lower circuit depths while maintaining security against all queries to 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , and 𝑈 𝑇 . Second, inspired by [36], we prove a gluing theorem for strong unitary designs and strong PRUs. This powerful technique allows us to reduce the circuit Figure 1: Illustration of our main results. (a) A strong approximate unitary 𝑘-design is a random unitary ensemble that is indistinguishable from Haar in any quantum experiment that queries 𝑈 or its inverse (i.e. time-reversal), conjugate, or transpose 𝑘 times. A strong pseudorandom unitary (PRU) is similarly indistinguishable in any polynomial-time experiment. (b) We construct strong unitary designs and PRUs on 𝑛 qubits in depth 𝒪(log 𝑛). Our constructions use long-range two-qubit gates to scramble quantum information over all 𝑛 qubits as fast as possible. (c) In comparison, low-depth one-dimensional quantum circuits can only scramble information over local regions. This allows them to form conventional designs [35,36] and PRUs [36], but not strong designs or strong PRUs. depth of our strong constructions to the optimal value of 𝒪(log 𝑛), which we prove is the minimum possible for any strong unitary design or strong PRU, and to establish strong unitary designs in depth 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) using all-to-all random circuits with Haar-random two-qubit gates. Third, to construct ancilla-free PRUs, we combine a new classical-to-quantum circuit compilation technique with our gluing theorems to construct standard PRUs in poly(log 𝑛) depth over 1D geometries and strong PRUs in poly(log 𝑛) depth over all-to-all geometries, both without using any ancilla qubits.",
    "Organization of this paper. Our manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define strong unitary designs and summarize our main results on their circuit depth. We also illustrate the failure of standard definitions of approximate unitary designs to capture experiments involving the time-reverse 𝑈 † and conjugate 𝑈 * . In Section 3, we define strong PRUs and summarize our main results on their circuit depth. In Section 4, we provide detailed descriptions of our constructions and proofs of strong unitary designs and PRUs. These involve three key ingredients as described above: the LRFC random unitary ensemble, a gluing construction for optimizing the circuit depth of strong random unitaries, and an adapted gluing construction for local random circuits. In Section 5, we discuss the relation between strong random unitaries and fast quantum information scrambling. We conclude in Section 6 with discussions and open questions.",
    "Approximate unitary designs seek to mimic Haar-random unitaries in applications that involve a random unitary only a finite number of times. Let us first review their standard definitions and then provide our strong definition and summarize our main results on strong unitary designs.",
    "Background. An exact unitary 𝑘-design on 𝑛 qubits is a random unitary ensemble ℰ whose 𝑘th moment, Φ ℰ (•) ≡ E 𝑈 ∼ℰ [𝑈 ⊗𝑘 (•)𝑈 †,⊗𝑘 ], equals the 𝑘-th moment of the Haar ensemble on 𝑈 (2 𝑛 ): Φ ℰ = Φ 𝐻 . While exact designs provide the strongest possible guarantees, efficient realizations beyond 𝑘 ≤ 3 are exceedingly rare.",
    "To address this limitation, several notions of approximate unitary 𝑘-designs have been introduced. We begin with the strongest such notion, the so-called relative error [32]. A unitary ensemble ℰ is an approximate unitary 𝑘-design with relative error 𝜀 if its moment obeys (1 -𝜀)Φ 𝐻 ⪯ Φ ℰ ⪯ (1 + 𝜀)Φ 𝐻 , where 𝒜 ⪯ ℬ indicates that ℬ -𝒜 is a completely positive map. Physically, the relative error guarantees that a random unitary 𝑈 ∼ ℰ cannot be distinguished from Haar-random in any quantum experiment that queries it up to 𝑘 times [36]. It also provides even stronger guarantees on properties that cannot be efficiently measured in any quantum experiment [39].",
    "Remarkably, unitary 𝑘-designs with relative error 𝜀 over 𝑛 qubits can form in extremely low circuit depths of Õ(𝑘 log 𝑛/𝜀) [35,36], growing only logarithmically in the number of qubits 𝑛. This holds even in one-dimensional systems with small light-cones. The dependence on 𝑛, 𝑘, and 𝜀 was further improved exponentially to 𝒪(𝑘 log 𝑘•log log(𝑛/𝜀)), to achieve relative error, and 𝒪(log 𝑘•log log(𝑛/𝜀)), to achieve a more physical notion of measurable error, for systems with long-range two-qubit gates [39].",
    "The existence of such low-depth unitary designs is counter-intuitive, as they appear to capture many features of Haar-random unitaries [35,36] without developing other characteristic features such as large light-cones, high entanglement, decay of out-of-time-order correlations, and good quantum encoding properties. Notably, these latter features are precisely the standard diagnostics of quantum information scrambling in many-body quantum physics and quantum gravity [15,20,25,26,[51][52][53][54][55][56].",
    "A resolution to this apparent paradox was provided in [36]: these scrambling-related features cannot be detected efficiently in any quantum experiment that queries only the forward evolution 𝑈 . Consequently, they do not form barriers to realizing low-depth unitary designs. However, many scrambling diagnostics can be efficiently detected in quantum experiments that involve the inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 of the unitary 𝑈 . These are precisely the experiments traditionally studied in quantum information scrambling [10,54,[57][58][59][60][61]. For example, estimating out-of-timeorder correlators to study butterfly effects requires time-reversal operations 𝑈 † [54,57,57], while the decoding protocol for the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment involves complex conjugation 𝑈 * [45]. This motivates a stronger notion of approximate unitary designs that captures experiments involving not just 𝑈 , but also 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , and 𝑈 𝑇 .",
    "Strong unitary designs. We define a strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 𝑘-design as any random unitary ensemble ℰ that cannot be distinguished from Haar-random in any quantum experiment that makes any 𝑘 queries to the unitary 𝑈 or its inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 . To be precise, if we denote the output of a general quantum experiment as",
    ", where each ∘ 𝑗 ∈ {•, †, 𝑇, *} represents forward evolution, inverse, transpose, or conjugate respectively, and 𝑊 𝑗 are arbitrary quantum operations applied between successive queries, then we demand",
    "for all choices of 𝑊 𝑗 and ∘ 𝑗 . This generalizes the notion of adaptive security for pseudorandom unitaries [11,42] and measurable error for unitary designs [39] to incorporate all variants of the unitary. We refer to Appendix A.1 for further discussion, including strong versions of other design approximation metrics. With this definition, a fundamental question arises: what circuit depths are required for strong unitary designs to form? A basic light-cone argument, which we formalize later, shows that strong unitary designs cannot form until information can propagate between any pair of qubits in the system. This requires the light-cone of the evolution to encompass all 𝑛 qubits, demanding depth Ω(log 𝑛) in general quantum circuits and dynamics. Can this extremely fast speed of scrambling actually be achieved? The fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics posits that all-to-all connected quantum systems can achieve logarithmic scrambling times [20]. However, existing progress toward proving this conjecture has focused on specific scrambling diagnostics, such as the decay of out-oftime-order correlators or the encoding properties of random unitaries [26,[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71]. A fully general operational proof of this conjecture has remained an open question.",
    "Our main result establishes that strong unitary designs can indeed form in optimal circuit depth 𝒪(log 𝑛) in all-to-all-connected architectures. This proves that every property of a random unitary measurable in a constant number of queries scrambles in logarithmic time.",
    "Theorem 1 (Fast formation of strong unitary designs). Strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 𝑘-designs can be realized in the following circuit depths:",
    "1. 𝑑 = 𝒪 (︀ log 𝑛 + log 𝑘 • log log(𝑛𝑘/𝜀) )︀ using all-to-all structured circuits with Õ(𝑛𝑘) ancilla qubits.",
    "2. 𝑑 = 𝒪 (︀ log 𝑛 + 𝑘 • log log(𝑛𝑘/𝜀) )︀ using all-to-all structured circuits with Õ(𝑛) ancilla qubits.",
    "For all-to-all random circuits consisting of independent Haar-random two-qubit gates without ancilla qubits, 𝑑 = 𝒪(𝑘 • poly log 𝑘 • log(𝑛/𝜀) + log 𝑛 • log(𝑛/𝜀)).",
    "The structured circuits achieve the optimal 𝒪(log 𝑛) scaling in system size when 𝑘 and 𝜀 are held constant, while the random circuits achieve an 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) scaling. The upper bounds for structured circuits are nearly optimal across all parameters, as confirmed by our lower bounds:",
    "Proposition 1. (Depth lower bounds for strong unitary designs) For any 𝜀 < 1/4, any circuit ensemble over 𝑛 qubits that forms a strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 𝑘-design requires circuit depth 𝑑:",
    "for any all-to-all circuits with any number of ancilla qubits.",
    "2. 𝑑 = Ω (︀ log 𝑛 + 𝑘/ log(𝑛𝑘) )︀ for any all-to-all circuits with at most 𝒪(𝑛) ancilla qubits.",
    "In contrast, for any 1D circuits with any number of ancilla qubits, 𝑑 = Ω (︀ 𝑛 + 𝑘/ log(𝑛𝑘) )︀ .",
    "The two items confirm near-optimality of our all-to-all constructions, while we also show an exponential separation between all-to-all connectivity and finite-dimensional geometries. We provide detailed constructions and proof techniques in Section 4 and complete proofs in Appendix A. In Appendix A.6, we also establish a surprising result showing that local random circuits require Ω(𝑛) depth to realize strong unitary designs with relative error, regardless of connectivity.",
    "Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) seek to mimic Haar-random unitaries in efficient quantum experiments. Let us first review their standard definition and then provide our strong definition and summarize our main results on strong PRUs.",
    "Background. A random unitary ensemble ℰ is a PRU if no efficient quantum algorithm can distinguish a random unitary 𝑈 ∼ ℰ from a Haar-random unitary under polynomially many queries to 𝑈 [11]. More precisely, ℰ is a PRU with security against any 𝑡(𝑛)-time quantum adversary if it cannot be distinguished from Haar-random in any 𝑡(𝑛)-time quantum experiment, where 𝑡(𝑛) is some function of the number of qubits 𝑛.",
    "The premier example is the Permutation-Function-Clifford (PFC) ensemble [40], 𝑈 = 𝑃 𝐹 𝐶, formed by multiplying a pseudorandom permutation 𝑃 , a pseudorandom function 𝐹 , and a random Clifford unitary 𝐶. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, the PFC ensemble achieves security against subexponential-time quantum adversaries [42]. However, it requires circuit depth poly(𝑛) to implement, even on all-to-all-connected geometries, due to the circuit depth of the pseudorandom permutation [36,73]. To further reduce these depths, we consider a glued construction, with two layers of small 2𝜉-qubit random unitaries (various colors) sandwiched between strong 𝑛qubit unitary 2-designs (green). This forms a strong unitary 𝑘-design when 𝜉 = Ω(log(𝑛𝑘/𝜀)) and a strong PRU when 𝜉 = 𝜔(log 𝑛). We instantiate each small unitary with the LRFC ensemble. (c) To obtain ancilla-free constructions, we replace each 𝑛-qubit 2-design with a fast scrambling circuit of depth log 𝑛 composed of 2𝜉-qubit 2-designs. For ancilla-free strong unitary designs consisting of Haar-random two-qubit gates, each small unitary is drawn from a random circuit on 2𝜉 qubits. For ancilla-free strong PRUs, each small unitary is implemented by reusing neighboring qubits as ancillae.",
    "Recent work has achieved exponential improvements in the circuit depths of standard PRUs. Ref. [36] reduces the depth to poly(log 𝑛) while maintaining security against polynomial-time quantum adversaries. The same work also discusses PRU realizations in even smaller circuit depths poly(log log 𝑛) using the LRFC ensemble introduced in our work. 3 We will show that the LRFC ensemble forms a strong PRU in circuit depth poly(log 𝑛), which yields circuit depth poly(log log 𝑛) for the two-layer LRFC ensemble considered in Ref. [36].",
    "Similar to standard unitary designs, existing PRUs exhibit a fundamental limitation: they only guarantee security against experiments that query the forward evolution 𝑈 . However, as discussed for strong unitary designs, many important quantum phenomena require experiments involving the inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 to be detected. Prior work partially addressed this by extending the PFC ensemble to achieve security against experiments querying both 𝑈 and 𝑈 † , using the construction 𝑈 = 𝐷𝑃 𝐹 𝐶 with an additional random Clifford 𝐷 [42]. However, this approach still omits conjugate and transpose operations, and requires poly(𝑛) circuit depth to implement. In our results that follow, we establish security under all queries to 𝑈, 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 and exponentially reduce the circuit depth from poly(𝑛) to 𝒪(log 𝑛).",
    "Strong pseudorandom unitaries. We define a strong PRU as any random unitary ensemble ℰ that cannot be distinguished from Haar-random in any efficient quantum experiment involving any combination of queries to the unitary 𝑈 or its inverse 𝑈 † , conjugate 𝑈 * , or transpose 𝑈 𝑇 . Formally, ℰ is a strong PRU with 𝑡(𝑛)-time security if it remains indistinguishable from Haar-random in any 𝑡(𝑛)-time quantum experiment, regardless of which operations are queried.",
    "Our main result establishes that strong PRUs can form in optimal circuit depth 𝒪(log 𝑛) in allto-all-connected architectures. This proves that every efficiently observable property of quantum (b) To show that the blocked fast scrambling circuit forms a strong 2-design, we prove that any unitary ensemble that uniformly spreads quantum information (purple) is a strong 2-design. The circuit spreads information over 𝑛 qubits in log 𝑛 layers. (c) To replace each 2𝜉-qubit unitary with a local random circuit, we prove a technical lemma that translates spectral gaps [32,34,72] to strong unitary designs.",
    "dynamics can achieve pseudorandomness in logarithmic time.",
    "Theorem 2 (Fast formation of strong PRUs). Under standard cryptographic assumptions, strong PRUs with polynomial-time security can be realized in the following circuit depths:",
    "1. 𝑑 = 𝒪(log 𝑛) using all-to-all structured circuits with Õ(𝑛) ancilla qubits.",
    "2. 𝑑 = poly(log 𝑛) using all-to-all structured circuits with no ancilla qubits.",
    "We describe our constructions and proof methods in Section 4 and provide a complete proof in Appendix B and Appendix E. The first result utilizes our LRFC ensemble [Fig. 2(a)] combined with our gluing theorem for strong random unitaries [Fig. 2(b)]. A circuit depth lower bound of Ω(log 𝑛) can be easily proven by noting that if the depth of 𝑈 is sublinear in log 𝑛, then an experiment that measures 𝑈 † 𝑋 1 𝑈 |0 𝑛 ⟩ in the all 𝑍 basis will result in a bitstring with almost all zeros, whereas a Haar-random unitary 𝑈 will result in a bitstring with almost equal number of zeros and ones. Hence, the achieved 𝑑 = 𝒪(log 𝑛) scaling is optimal. The second result combines the LRFC ensemble, our gluing theorem, and a new strategy for compiling random classical functions in quantum circuits and gluing them together by reusing system qubits on other local patches as ancilla qubits. Both results rely only on the subexponential hardness of standard learning with errors (LWE) [48]. All of our results immediately extend to quantum experiments involving queries to the controlled versions of 𝑈, 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 , following the general reduction in [49,50].",
    "Having summarized our main results, we now introduce our random unitary ensembles. We proceed in three parts. In Section 4.1, we introduce the Luby-Rackoff-Function-Clifford (LRFC) ensemble. We prove that the LRFC ensemble forms a strong unitary design in 𝒪(log 𝑘•log 𝑛) depth and a strong PRU in poly(log 𝑛) depth. In Section 4.2, we introduce a gluing construction for strong random unitaries, which allows us to further optimize each circuit depth to 𝒪(log 𝑛 + log 𝑘 log log 𝑘) and 𝒪(log 𝑛). In Section 4.4, we introduce a modified gluing construction inspired by toy-model fast scrambling circuits in black hole physics [20,21]. We use this to prove that all-to-all-connected local random circuits can form strong unitary 𝑘-designs in depth 𝒪(𝑘 • poly log 𝑘 • log 𝑛/𝜀 + log 𝑛 • log 𝑛/𝜀).",
    "The Luby-Rackoff-Function-Clifford (LRFC) ensemble is inspired by the Permutation-Function-Clifford (PFC) ensemble introduced in [40]. The key difference is that it replaces the random permutation in the PFC ensemble with a pair of random shuffle gates, which use only random functions. This replacement leads to an exponential improvement in circuit depth, since known constructions of quantum-secure pseudorandom functions [74] are much more efficient than those of pseudorandom permutations [73]. The random shuffle gates are inspired by the Luby-Rackoff block cipher in classical cryptography [75]. Crucially, we show that the random shuffle gates mimic the action of a random permutation within the LRFC circuit.",
    "We define the LRFC ensemble as follows. We consider the random unitary,",
    "The unitaries 𝐶 and 𝐷 are drawn from any strong unitary 2-design on 𝑛 qubits. For example, they can each be a random Clifford unitary, which are exact unitary 2-designs. The unitary 𝐹 is a random ternary phase gate, 𝐹 = ∑︀ 𝑥∈{0,1} 𝑛 𝜔 𝑓 (𝑥) |𝑥⟩⟨𝑥|, where 𝜔 ≡ 𝑒 𝑖 2𝜋 3 and 𝑓 : {0, 1} 𝑛 → {0, 1, 2} is a random function. Finally, the unitaries 𝑆 𝐿 and 𝑆 𝑅 are random shuffle gates, which shuffle the bitstring of the left (or right) 𝑛/2 qubits conditional on the value of the right (or left) 𝑛/2 qubits. That is, 𝑆 𝐿 |𝑥 𝐿 , 𝑥 𝑅 ⟩ = |𝑥 𝐿 + ℎ 1 (𝑥 𝑅 ), 𝑥 𝑅 ⟩ where 𝑥 𝐿 , 𝑥 𝑅 ∈ {0, 1} 𝑛/2 are the left and right 𝑛/2 bits and",
    "To implement the LRFC ensemble efficiently, we will replace each random function in the phase and shuffle gates with a less-random efficient approximation. To construct strong unitary 𝑘-designs, we will replace each random function with an exact 2𝑘-wise independent function [76]. This replicates the first 2𝑘 moments of a random function, which guarantees that any quantum experiment making 𝑘 queries will proceed identically to if the function was random. The factor of two accounts for the bra and ket of the quantum state. Exact 2𝑘-wise independent functions can be implemented in quantum circuit depth 𝒪(𝑘 • log 𝑛) using Õ(𝑛) ancilla qubits, or depth 𝒪(log 𝑘 • log 𝑛) using Õ(𝑛𝑘) ancilla qubits [39]. To construct strong PRUs, we will replace each random function with a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (PRF) [74]. This is indistinguishable from a random function in any bounded time quantum experiment. Strong PRFs with security against any subexponential-time quantum adversary can be implemented in quantum circuit depth poly(log 𝑛) [36,74].",
    "Our main result is that the LRFC circuit forms a strong unitary 𝑘-design (when each random function is replaced with a 2𝑘-wise independent function) and a strong PRU (when each random function is replaced with a quantum-secure pseudorandom function).",

    "We can further improve upon the circuit depths of the LRFC ensemble by establishing a fundamental property of strong random unitaries. Namely, we prove that two strong random unitaries on overlapping subsystems \"glue\" together, whenever they are surrounded by larger unitary 2-designs [Fig. 3(a)]. Intuitively, the larger 2-designs scramble the input to the strong random unitaries, which guarantees that the overlap of the input state with counter-examples to the strong gluing construction is exceedingly small. This allows us to reduce the circuit depth of strong unitary 𝑘-designs and strong PRUs to match the circuit depth of unitary 2-designs, i.e. 𝒪(log 𝑛) [68].",
    "We consider the random unitary ensemble depicted in Fig. 2(b). Inspired by [36], we partition the 𝑛 qubits into 𝑛/𝜉 patches of 𝜉 qubits each, arranged in a 1D line. We then form a two-layer circuit composed of small strong random unitaries, where the small unitaries act on two neighboring patches each and are arranged in a brickwork fashion between the two layers. Finally, we \"scramble\" the two-layer circuit by appending it with an 𝑛-qubit strong unitary 2-design on either side.",

    "The theorems immediately yield strong unitary designs and strong PRUs in the circuit depths in Theorems 1 and 2. This follows by adding the circuit depth 𝒪(log 𝑛) of an exact unitary 2-design [68] to the circuit depths of the LRFC ensemble on 2𝜉 qubits5 .",
    "As mentioned above, we analyze the scrambled two-layer ensemble by proving that one can glue small strong random unitaries together one brick at a time [36]. Without the larger unitary 2-designs, this gluing does not hold. Applying the following lemma 𝑛/𝜉 times yields Theorems 5 and 6.",

    "We prove Lemma 1 in Appendix D.1 using the path-recording framework from [42]. We find that the path-recording framework enables the most effective analyses of strong random unitaries. This contrasts with standard approximate unitary designs and PRUs, where other succinct approaches based on the permutation group are possible [36,39].",
    "In this section, we give the first constructions of ancilla-free PRUs and strong PRUs. Our main crytographic building block will be pseudorandom functions [77] computable in the complexity class \"logspace-uniform TC 1 \".

Based on this work, it is known that logspace-uniform TC 1 functions can be implemented in a somewhat ancilla-independent way. Namely, they require poly(𝑛) ancilla qubits but only 𝑂(log 𝑛) clean ancilla qubits: if the clean ancillae are all initialized to |0⟩, the circuit properly computes the function and acts as identity on the remaining ancillae. In Section E, we show how to remove the need for these these last 𝒪(log 𝑛) clean ancillae by exploiting a number of reversible circuit identities.",

Crucially, the strong PRU blocks can reuse registers that serve as the ancilla registers of other PRU blocks, due to their ancilla-independence. This gives ancilla-free strong PRUs on 𝑛 qubits of poly(𝑛) depth. To compress the depth down to poly(log 𝑛), we instantiate the two-layer ensemble again, with • 𝜔(log 2 𝑛)-depth ancilla-free instantiations of the unitary 2-designs; see Lemma 2 of the following section and set 𝜀 -1 = 𝜔(poly 𝑛), and",

This generality is not trivial; for example, standard unitary designs can be implemented in circuit depth 𝒪(log log 𝑛) in highly structured unitary ensembles, but require depth Ω(log 𝑛) in local random circuits on any architecture [36,39,80].",
    "Our random circuit construction builds upon the scrambled two-layer ensemble introduced in the previous section [Fig. 2(c)]. We modify the ensemble in two ways to enable a random circuit realization. First, we replace both of the 𝑛-qubit unitary 2-designs with blocked fast scrambling circuits, composed of small unitary 2-designs acting on 2𝜉 qubits each. The small unitary 2-designs are arranged such that the 𝑖-th patch of qubits is coupled to the (𝑖 + 2 𝑑-1 )-patch of qubits at the 𝑑-th circuit layer. This guarantees that the light-cone of every qubit doubles at every circuit layer, so that every light-cone encompasses all 𝑛 qubits after log 2 (𝑛/𝜉) layers. Second, we replace all of the small random unitaries in the ensemble with 1D local random circuits [32]. We specify the depths of these circuits below. The circuit is highly unstructured, in the sense that each two-qubit gate is drawn independently at random from the Haar measure on 𝑈 (4).",
    "To prove that the first modification is valid, we show that the blocked fast scrambling circuit is a strong unitary 2-design.",
    "Lemma 2 (The blocked fast scrambling circuit is a strong unitary 2-design). Let each small random unitary be a strong 𝜀 𝑛 -approximate unitary 2-design with depth 𝑑. Then the blocked fast scrambling circuit forms a strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 2-design with depth 𝑑 log 2 (𝑛/𝜉) for any 𝜉 ≥ log 2 (5𝑛/𝜀).",
    "We then prove that each small strong approximate unitary design can be replaced with a 1D local random circuit.",
    "Lemma 3 (1D random circuits are strong unitary 𝑘-designs). 1D random circuits on 𝑛 qubits form strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 𝑘-designs in depth 𝑑 = Ω (︀ log(𝑘) 7 (𝑛𝑘 + log(1/𝜀))",
    "This requires circuit depth 𝒪(poly log 𝑘(𝜉𝑘 + log 𝑛/𝜀)) for the two layers of small unitary 𝑘-designs, and depth 𝒪(𝜉 + log 𝑛/𝜀) per layer for the log 2 (𝑛/𝜉) layers of small unitary 2-designs. Setting 𝜉 = 𝒪(log 𝑛𝑘/𝜀) as in Theorem 5 yields a total circuit depth of 𝒪(𝑘•poly log 𝑘•log 𝑛/𝜀+log 𝑛•log 𝑛𝑘/𝜀).",
    "The proofs of Lemma 2 and Lemma 3 are contained in Appendix D.2 and A.4, respectively. We prove Lemma 2 by establishing a formal connection between operator spreading and strong unitary 2-designs. Operator spreading refers to the growth in support of initially local operators under a quantum circuit or time dynamics; this signifies the scrambling of local information into non-local correlations [25,26,52]. In random circuits, this growth is probabilistic and is characterized by a probability distribution over the set of Pauli strings [55]. We show that an ensemble forms a strong  [21]. This follows because the decoding protocol uses the conjugate random unitary [45]. (c) In a strong unitary 4-design or strong pseudorandom unitary, the operator size distribution approaches its Haar-random value to within small total variational distance. unitary 2-design if and only if its operator spreading distributions are close to those of a Haar-random unitary. To establish that the blocked fast scrambling circuit satisfies this condition, we prove that with high probability every operator is randomly supported within its light-cone at every layer.",
    "The statement of Lemma 3 for strong unitary designs closely parallels an analogous statement for standard unitary designs [34]. These statements are derived by translating lower bounds on the spectral gap of random circuits to upper bounds on their design depth [32]. This translation involves several steps: One first uses the spectral gap to bound the so-called additive error of a unitary design, and then translates the additive error to a bound on the relative error. For standard unitary designs, this translation can either be proven using the Schur-Weyl duality [32] or from elementary properties of the permutation operators [36]. In Appendix A.1, we provide an analogous additive-to-relativeerror translation result for strong unitary designs. Our analysis yields numerous insights into the structure of the mixed Haar twirl, which may be useful in other contexts. For example, we formalize the following statement: Within any quantum experiment, a Haar-random unitary 𝑈 and its inverse 𝑈 † either cancel one another, or behave identically to two independent random unitaries 𝑈 and 𝑉 .",
    "We now elaborate on the connections between our results and fast quantum information scrambling. Quantum information scrambling is a broad field focused on understanding the spreading of quantum information in dynamical many-body quantum systems. As discussed in detail in our introduction, the fast scrambling conjecture [20] posits that (i) all-to-all-connected quantum systems can scramble information in time growing only logarithmically in the system size 𝑛, and (ii) this is the fastest that any quantum system can scramble information.",
    "Our construction of strong unitary 𝑘-designs and strong pseudorandom unitaries in 𝒪(log 𝑛) circuit depth provides the strongest confirmation to date of the fast scrambling conjecture. These results prove that every observable feature of unitary quantum dynamics can mimic Haar-random behavior in logarithmic depth. This significantly expands upon existing works, which, as aforementioned, focus on either a small number of specific signatures or solely unitary 2-design properties [26,[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71]. Meanwhile, our lower bound, which is simple to derive, confirms that a logarithmic depth is optimal for any unitary to appear Haar-random in experiments that involve the inverse or conjugate.",
    "We illustrate the connection between strong unitary designs and strong PRUs and quantum information scrambling in more detail through several examples (Fig. 4). We consider four hallmark diagnostics of quantum information scrambling: (a) the decay of all local time-ordered and outof-time-order correlation functions [25], (b) the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment [21], (c) the saturation of operator size distributions to their Haar-random profile [26], and (d) the growth of the entanglement and operator entanglement entropies. The implications of our results for each behavior follow straightforwardly from our definitions of strong unitary 𝑘-designs and strong PRUs. We discuss this example-by-example below.",
    "Decay of all out-of-time-order correlation functions. Perhaps the simplest diagnostic of scrambling is the decay of all local correlation functions to zero [53]. This includes both conventional time-ordered correlations functions (TOCs), as well as out-of-time-order correlations functions (OTOCs) [25]. The former can be measured with forward time-evolution under 𝑈 . Crucially however, the latter can only be efficiently measured by alternating forward and backward time-evolution under 𝑈 and 𝑈 † [Fig. 4(a)]. In Appendix G, we provide a short proof that all local 𝑘-point correlation functions are near zero with high probability in any strong unitary 2𝑘-design. A similar statement holds for strong PRUs. This complements existing observations that OTOCs can decay in logarithmic time in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model [62,63] and all-to-all-connected random circuits [24,56]. Our results capture both standard four-point OTOCs as well as higher-point OTOCs, which have risen in interest in recent work [10,[81][82][83][84].",
    "Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. A key inspiration for early studies of quantum information scrambling came from the black hole information paradox [85]. In this context, Hayden and Preskill proposed that, if one models the dynamics of a black hole by a random unitary, then one could use the Hawking radiation collected from a black hole to recover a quantum state that fell into the black hole at an earlier time [21]. An explicit decoding protocol was later provided by Yoshida and Kitaev [45]. Crucially, the decoding protocol utilizes the conjugate random unitary 𝑈 * [Fig. 4(b)]. Thus, any strong unitary 2-design or strong pseudorandom unitary will encode information precisely as well as a Haar-random unitary in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment 6 . Intriguingly, this result does not seem to extend to all applications of Haar-random unitaries as quantum codes; in particular, it applies only when the decoding can be performed efficiently using query access to 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 .",
    "Growth of operator size distributions. An even more fine-grained diagnostic of quantum information scrambling is the operator size distribution [26]. The size distribution characterizes the support of a time-evolved operator when expanded in the Pauli basis, 𝑂(𝑡)",
    ", where the sum is over all Pauli operators of weight (i.e. size) 𝒮. Operator size distributions and are central to applications of information scrambling in quantum gravity [22][23][24]26], quantum sensing [86], and understanding the impact of noise on quantum systems [47,56,60]. In Appendix G, we prove that the operator size distribution of any strong 𝜀-approximate unitary 4-design is 𝑛 2 𝜀-close to its Haar-random value in total variational distance. Setting 𝜀 = 1/𝜔(poly 𝑛) yields operator size distributions that are super-polynomially close to their Haar values in circuit depth 𝒪(log 𝑛).",
    "Entanglement and operator entanglement entropy. Finally, we consider the entanglement and operator entanglement entropies. In principle, neither of these quantities can be efficiently measured in any quantum experiment. Therefore their values in a Haar-random state need not be replicated by approximate strong unitary designs or strong PRUs. Nonetheless, in Appendix G, we show that an especially precise form of strong unitary designs, characterized by a small relative error, can efficiently capture the entanglement and operator entanglement entropies. In Appendix C, we show that such designs can be formed in 𝒪(log 𝑛) circuit depth. From this, we find that the Renyi-2 entanglement entropy of any subsystem of any time-evolved state |𝜓(𝑡)⟩ ≡ 𝑈 |𝜓⟩ reaches its Haar-random value in 𝒪(log 𝑛) depth. In addition, the Renyi-2 operator entanglement entropy of any subsystem of any time-evolved operator 𝑂(𝑡) ≡ 𝑈 𝑂𝑈 † reaches its Haar-random value in 𝒪(log 𝑛) depth. Formally, these bounds are achieved by reformulating each entropy as the expectation value of a positive-valued operator after 𝑈 and 𝑈 * are applied to a fictitious larger system.",
    "Our results provide the strongest constructions of approximate unitary designs and PRUs to date. Moreover, the circuit depths of our constructions achieve the optimal Θ(log 𝑛) scaling, as predicted by the fast scrambling conjecture. These results establish a rigorous operational foundation for quantum information scrambling and represent the most comprehensive confirmation of fast scrambling to date, capturing all efficiently observable quantum experiments. Our work leaves open several interesting questions.",
    "We have motivated strong unitary designs and strong PRUs from applications to quantum information scrambling and black hole physics. What other applications of strong random unitaries might exist? For example, can strong unitary designs help us understand the classical hardness of recent quantum advantage proposals involving time-reversal dynamics [10,61]? Or perhaps the sensitivity of such experiments to experimental noise [56]? More broadly, can strong random unitaries assist in device benchmarking and other quantum learning tasks?",
    "Our constructions provide the first examples of PRUs secure against queries to all of 𝑈 , 𝑈 † , 𝑈 * , and 𝑈 𝑇 . Can the existence of these strong PRUs and the ability to generate them in logarithmic depth enable new quantum cryptographic applications [46]? Our ancilla-free constructions address a fundamental limitation of previous PRU constructions, which relied on auxiliary systems that are unrealistic in physical settings. This advance opens a deeper question: can we build upon ancillafree strong random unitaries to demonstrate that dynamics naturally arising in condensed matter, quantum chaos, and high-energy physics form strong random unitaries?",
    "More broadly, giving ancilla-free constructions of any quantum cryptographic object-such as commitments, encryption, uncloneable cryptography, etc.-can constitute a stronger form of evidence (compared to a pure existential result) that natural physical phenomena may possess these cryptographic properties. This motivates understanding whether, and under what hardness assumptions, other quantum cryptographic primitives have efficient ancilla-free instantiations.",
    "Finally, our new techniques for analyzing strong random unitaries raise several questions. Can the circuit depth of our local random circuit construction of strong unitary designs be further improved, from 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) to 𝒪(log 𝑛)? In particular, our treatment of the blocked fast scrambling circuit is extremely coarse and likely leaves room for an improved analysis. Along similar lines, can one further remove the structure from our random circuit designs, and prove the fast formation of strong unitary designs in the standard model of all-to-all random circuits [64][65][66]? More broadly, can our refined techniques for analyzing the mixed-unitary twirl [87][88][89]",
    "In this Appendix, we provide the full details of our definition and constructions of strong unitary designs. Beyond the first preliminaries and definitions section, we have structured each subsection so that they can be read relatively independently of one another.",
    "In this section, we introduce and define strong unitary 𝑘-designs for various notions of approximation error. Our definitions are closely modeled on the analogous definitions for (standard) unitary 𝑘designs. With this in mind, we first review the standard definitions of unitary designs. We then briefly discuss the limitations of these definitions in regards to fast scrambling and quantum experiments involving time-reversal. We then introduce our strong definitions to capture such behaviors.",
    "To provide the definitions of unitary designs, let us first introduce the average (i.e. twirl ) over a Haar-random unitary. This will form our point of comparison in the study of unitary designs. We consider two varieties of the twirl in our work: the Haar twirl and the mixed Haar twirl.",
    "The Haar twirl. The Haar twirl has the following definition.",
    "Definition 1 (The Haar twirl). Given a linear operator 𝑋 acting on 𝑛𝑘 qubits, the 𝑘-th moment with respect to 𝑈 (2 𝑛 ) is defined via the twirl over the unitary group:",
    "An explicit formula for the Haar twirl can be derived from a simple argument in representation theory [90][91][92]. This yields the following expression.",
    "Lemma 4 (Explicit expression for the Haar twirl). For any 𝑘 ≤ 2 𝑛 . For any linear operator 𝑋 acting on 𝑛𝑘 qubits, the 𝑘-th moment with respect to the unitary group can be written in the form",
    "where 𝜋, π ∈ 𝑆 𝑘 permute the 𝑘 copies of the 𝑛-qubit Hilbert space, and the Weingarten matrix elements Wg 𝜋,π depend on 𝑘 and the Hilbert space dimension 2 𝑛 .",
    "The mixed Haar twirl. To incorporate quantum experiments that can query the inverse and conjugate of a random unitary, we will also make use of the mixed Haar twirl in our work. Here, the 𝑘 copies of the unitary 𝑈 are replaced by 𝑝 copies of 𝑈 and 𝑞 copies of its conjugate 𝑈 * .",
    "Definition 2 (The mixed Haar twirl). Given a linear operator 𝑋 acting on 𝑛𝑘 qubits, the (𝑝, 𝑞)-th moment with respect to 𝑈 (2 𝑛 ) is defined via the mixed twirl over the unitary group:",
    "The mixed Haar twirl can be obtained from the standard Haar twirl by taking the partial transpose of the last 𝑞 registers before and after (𝑈 * ) ⊗𝑞 is applied. Thus, the expression for the mixed Haar twirl is fully determined by the expression for the standard Haar twirl.",
    "Lemma 5 (Explicit expression for the mixed Haar twirl). For any 𝑝+𝑞 ≤ 2 𝑛 . For any linear operator 𝑋 acting on 𝑛𝑘 qubits, the (𝑝, 𝑞)-th moment with respect to the unitary group can be written",
    "where Γ is the partial transpose on the final 𝑞 registers.",
    "Proof. The expression follows from the equality Φ (𝑝,𝑞)",
    "𝐻 (𝑋 Γ ) Γ . The partial transpose Γ is then transferred from 𝑋 to 𝜋 -1 inside the trace using tr",
    "Let us now turn to unitary designs. A unitary ensemble is an exact unitary 𝑘-design if it exactly replicates the first 𝑘 moments of a Haar-random unitary.",
    "Definition 3 (Exact unitary 𝑘-design). An ensemble of unitaries ℰ is an exact unitary 𝑘-design if it exactly reproduces the first 𝑘 moments of the Haar measure",
    "where we have used the abbreviated notation",
    "to denote the 𝑘-th moment over the unitary ensemble ℰ.",
    "An exact design is the strongest notion of unitary design. It guarantees that any experiment that queries the unitary 𝑈 (or 𝑈 † or 𝑈 𝑇 or 𝑈 * or controlled versions of any of these quantities) up to 𝑘 times exactly reproduces the output of the same experiment querying a Haar-random unitary 7 .",
    "In practice, exact constructions of unitary designs are extremely scarce beyond very low moments 𝑘 ≤ 3. This motivates the notion of an approximate design. Three forms of approximation error for unitary designs are common.",
    "Additive error. The simplest form of approximation error is the additive or diamond-norm error.",
    "Definition 4 (Unitary 𝑘-design with additive error). Let 𝜀 > 0. An ensemble of unitaries ℰ is an approximate unitary 𝑘-design with additive error",
    "where ‖Φ -Φ ′ ‖ ◇ ≡ max 𝜌 ‖Φ(𝜌) -Φ ′ (𝜌)‖ 1 is the diamond norm. The maximization is over all states 𝜌 on 𝑛𝑘 + 𝑚 qubits, where the number 𝑚 of ancilla qubits may be arbitrarily large.",
    "Physically, the additive error is equivalent to security under parallel queries to the unitary 𝑈 . Namely, an ensemble ℰ is an approximate unitary 𝑘-design up to additive error 𝜀 if and only if for any quantum algorithm making a single query to 𝑈 ⊗𝑘 , i.e. 𝑘 parallel queries to 𝑈 , the output states when 𝑈 is sampled from ℰ versus the Haar ensemble are 𝜀-close in trace distance [39]. This follows immediately from the definition of the diamond norm.",
    "Measurable error. The additive error has a significant drawback, in that it can only capture experiments in which 𝑈 is applied 𝑘 times in parallel. To address this, Ref. [39] introduced a stronger notion of approximation error, which guarantees that an ensemble is indistinguishable from Haarrandom in any quantum experiment that queries 𝑈 up to 𝑘 times. This is termed the measurable error owing to its physical motivation.",
    "Definition 5 (Unitary 𝑘-design with measurable error). Let 𝜀 > 0. An ensemble of unitaries ℰ is an approximate unitary 𝑘-design with measurable error 𝜀 if for any quantum experiment with 𝑘 queries to 𝑈 , the output states when 𝑈 is sampled from ℰ versus the Haar ensemble are 𝜀-close in trace distance,",

    "to denote the expected output state of a general quantum experiment that queries 𝑈 𝑘 times. Each 𝑊 𝑖 is an arbitrary unitary on 𝑛 + 𝑚 qubits, where the number 𝑚 of ancilla qubits may be arbitrarily large.",
    "In the definition, we can assume without loss of generality that each 𝑈 is applied in sequence on the same subsystem 𝐴 of 𝑛 qubits. If the unitaries are in fact applied in parallel, this is equivalent to performing the first unitary 𝑈 , then using 𝑊 1 to swap 𝐴 with 𝑛 ancilla qubits, then performing the second unitary 𝑈 , then using 𝑊 2 to swap back 𝐴 and the 𝑛 ancilla qubits, and so on.",
    "The measurable error is in some sense the most natural notion of approximation error for unitary designs. It captures precisely the features of a random unitary that can be measured in physical experiments that query the unitary.",
    "Relative error. The strongest notion of approximation error for unitary designs is the relative error. Unlike the additive or measurable errors, the relative error is sensitive to properties that cannot be efficient measured in any quantum experiment. It has the following definition.",
    "Definition 6 (Unitary 𝑘-design with relative error). Let 𝜀 > 0. Then an ensemble of unitaries ℰ is an approximate unitary 𝑘-design up to relative error 𝜀 if",

This holds even if the expectation value is exponentially small and cannot be efficient measured.",
    "Translating between unitary design approximation errors. We can translate between different notions of approximation error for unitary designs as follows.",
    "Lemma 6 (Translating between different approximation errors [32,36,39]). The additive error 𝜀 𝑎 is upper bounded by the measurable error 𝜀 𝑚 , which is in turn upper bounded by twice the relative error",
    "Conversely, the relative error is bounded by the additive error times an exponentially large pre-factor,",
    "where the second inequality holds for 𝑘 2 ≤ 2 𝑛 .",
    "We can now introduce our strong notions of approximation error for unitary designs. To do so, let us first highlight the weakness of standard definitions towards capturing experiments that query the inverse or conjugate of a random unitary. We then introduce our definitions to resolve this.",
    "Weakness of standard definitions of approximate unitary designs. We can illustrate the weakness of standard definitions of approximate unitary designs with two examples. The examples involve experiments that perform one query to 𝑈 and one query to either the inverse or the conjugate. We show that both experiments can easily distinguish any low-depth unitary from Haar-random. Since low-depth circuits can form relative error unitary designs, this implies that such designs are not sufficient for bounding properties of such experiments. At a formal level, the translation from the relative error to the trace-norm error in the output of an experiment querying the inverse or conjugate incurs an exponential factor of 2 𝑛 , which ruins the error bound when the number of qubits 𝑛 is large. Our first and simplest example involves the inverse unitary [93,94]. Consider a quantum experiment that prepares the zero state on all qubits, scrambles the system via 𝑈 , then applies a Pauli operator 𝑋 1 on the first qubit, then attempts to un-scramble the system via 𝑈 † . If 𝑈 is Haar-random, the Pauli perturbation completely disrupts the time-reversal, resulting in an effectively Haar-random state after 𝑈 † is applied. On the other hand, if 𝑈 is low-depth, all qubits outside of the light-cone of Figure 5: Reformulation of any quantum experiment that makes any 𝑘 queries to 𝑈 , 𝑈 * , 𝑈 𝑇 , or 𝑈 † as an alternative experiment that makes a single query to 𝑈 ⊗𝑝 ⊗ 𝑈 *,⊗𝑞 and performs 𝑘 post-selections on 𝑛-qubit Bell states. Here, 𝑝 counts the number of applications of 𝑈 and 𝑈 𝑇 and 𝑞 counts the number of applications of 𝑈 * and 𝑈 † . The subsystem labels match the notation used in our proofs based on the path-recording framework (Appendix D. 1 andC).",
    "the first qubit return to the zero state under 𝑈 † . Hence, one can measure e.g. the fidelity for the last qubit to return to the zero state to easily distinguish any low-depth unitary from Haar-random.",
    "Our second example is similar but replaces the inverse unitary with the conjugate. Consider an experiment that prepars the EPR state between two copies of 𝑛 qubits, applies a Pauli operator 𝑋 1 on the first qubit of the left side, then applies 𝑈 and 𝑈 * in parallel to the left and right side. This yields the state",
    "|Ψ EPR ⟩ for any operator 𝑂. When 𝑈 is Haar-random, the operator 𝑈 𝑋 1 𝑈 † is a seemingly random operator on all 𝑛 qubits. This implies that the fidelity for any pair of qubits between the left and right side to be in the EPR state is close to its maximally mixed value, 1/4 On the other hand, when 𝑈 is low depth, the operator 𝑈 𝑋 1 𝑈 † has support only on a small light-cone around the first qubit. Thus, the fidelity of e.g. the last pair of qubits to remain in the EPR state is equal to 1. Hence, one can again easily distinguish any low-depth unitary from Haar-random.",
    "Strong measurable error. We can now introduce our definitions of strong unitary designs. We introduce each definition in order of its prominence in our work.",
    "We begin with the strong analog of the measurable error. We say that a unitary ensemble is a strong unitary design with measurable error if it is indistinguishable from a Haar-random unitary in any quantum experiment with any combination 𝑘 queries to 𝑈 or 𝑈 † or 𝑈 𝑇 or 𝑈 * . Definition 7 (Strong unitary 𝑘-design with measurable error). Let 𝜀 > 0. An ensemble of unitaries ℰ is a strong approximate unitary 𝑘-design with measurable error 𝜀 if for any quantum experiment with any combination of 𝑘 queries to 𝑈 or 𝑈 † or 𝑈 𝑇 or 𝑈 * , the output states when 𝑈 is sampled from ℰ versus the Haar ensemble are 𝜀-close in trace distance,",

    "Due to its natural definition, we will adopt the strong measurable error as our default error metric for strong unitary designs. Hence, in later sections, we will often refer to an approximate unitary 𝑘-design with measurable error 𝜀 as simply an 𝜀-approximate unitary 𝑘-design.",
    "Strong relative error. We can also define analogs of the relative error and additive error for strong unitary designs. These share similar drawbacks to the definitions of the relative and additive error for standard unitary designs (as discussed in the previous section). Nonetheless, they will be convenient for select technical purposes in our analysis. For convenience, we state the definitions in terms of the number of queries 𝑝 to 𝑈 or 𝑈 𝑇 and the number of queries 𝑞 to 𝑈 * or 𝑈 † , instead of the total number of queries 𝑘 = 𝑝 + 𝑞.",
    "Definition 8 (Unitary (𝑝, 𝑞)-design with relative error). Let 𝜀 > 0. Then an ensemble of unitaries ℰ is an approximate unitary (𝑝, 𝑞)-design with relative error 𝜀 if",
    "The relative error guarantees that the expectation value of any positive-valued operator 𝜒 in the output state of any quantum experiment that performs any combination of 𝑝 queries to 𝑈 or 𝑈 † and 𝑞 queries to 𝑈 𝑇 or 𝑈 * , is equal to its Haar value to within multiplicative precision. This follows from the fact that any such experiment can be reformulated as an experiment that performs 𝑝 and 𝑞 parallel queries to 𝑈 and 𝑈 * and post-selects on the EPR state (Fig. 5).",
    "Strong additive error. Finally, we define the additive error for strong unitary designs as follows.",

    "Physically, the additive error is equivalent to security under 𝑝 parallel queries to 𝑈 and 𝑞 parallel queries to 𝑈 * . In principle, one could extend this definition to include parallel queries to 𝑈 † and 𝑈 𝑇 as well. However, the only use of the additive error in our work is as a stepping stone to prove small relative and measurable errors, and the current definition will be sufficient for these purposes.",
    "Translating between strong unitary design approximation errors. As in the standard case, it is possible translate between different notions of approximation error for strong unitary designs. We formalize this in the following lemma. The first statement of the lemma follows immediately from the definitions of the approximation errors. The second statement is a significant result of our work. We provide the proof of the second statement in Section A.",
    "In Section A.4, we apply the second statement of the lemma to translate existing results on the spectral gap of one-dimensional random circuits into the statement that such circuits form strong unitary designs with small relative error.",
    "In this section, we build a basic framework for understanding the structure of the mixed Haar twirl. We first use this framework to derive a simpler approximate formula for the mixed Haar twirl. We then use this approximate formula to prove the second statement of Lemma 7, which allows one to perform tight translations between the additive and relative errors of strong unitary designs.",
    "Let us begin by re-printing the formula for the mixed Haar twirl from Lemma 5,",
    "where 𝜎 ≡ 𝜋 Γ and 𝜏 ≡ πΓ are summed over the partially transposed permutations, 𝑆 Γ 𝑘 . Here, we define ̃︂ Wg 𝜎,𝜏 ≡ Wg 𝜋,π . While this formula is simple to write down, it provides fairly little intuition about the properties and behavior of the mixed Haar twirl. We begin this section by reformulating this expression in a more intuitive manner. We will then derive our approximate expression for the mixed Haar twirl from this reformulation. For brevity, we defer the proofs of several facts stated in our reformulation of the mixed Haar twirl to the later Appendix F. The proofs are straightforward but require many detailed steps.",
    "Unlike the permutation operators, which appear in the standard Haar twirl, the partially transposed permutations are not necessarily unitary. Indeed, a key role in the mixed Haar twirl is played by a subset of partially transposed permutations that are projectors. Consider any permutation 𝜋 that is equal to a tensor product of (i) identity elements, and (ii) swap operations between a copy on the left side and a copy on the right side. Here, the \"left side\" corresponds to the 𝑝 copies that 𝑈 acts on, and the \"right side\" to the 𝑞 copies that 𝑈 * acts on. When 𝜋 is partially transposed, it results in a permutation 𝜎 = 𝜋 Γ that is a tensor product of (i) identity elements, and (ii) EPR projectors between a copy on the left side and a copy on the right side. This follows because the partial transpose of a swap operator is proportional to an EPR projector, 𝒮 Γ 𝑖𝑗 = 2 𝑛 𝑃 EPR,𝑖𝑗 for copies 𝑖, 𝑗. If we label the set of pairs between the left and right side as 𝛼 𝜎 = {(𝑖 1 , 𝑗 1 ), (𝑖 2 , 𝑗 2 ), . . . , (𝑖 |𝛼𝜎| , 𝑗 |𝛼𝜎| )}, then 𝑃 𝛼𝜎 ≡ 𝜎/2 𝑛|𝛼𝜎| projects onto EPR states on every pair in 𝛼 𝜎 and acts trivially on the remaining copies.",

    "Here, -ℓ) that is orthogonal to every EPR projector between a copy 𝑖 on the left side and 𝑗 on the right side. Meanwhile, 𝒜 ℓ is an auxiliary Hilbert space of dimension",
    "This equals the number of distinct sets of ℓ pairs between the left and right side. Intuitively, the ℓ-th subspace in the tensor sum contains all states in ℋ ⊗𝑝 ⊗ℋ ⊗𝑞 that have exactly ℓ EPR pairs between the left and right sides. There are",
    ")︀ ℓ! ways to place the ℓ EPR pairs, which are indexed by the subsystem 𝒜 ℓ . Once placed, the remaining 𝑝 -ℓ and 𝑞 -ℓ copies are free to be in any quantum state that has zero EPR pairs between the left and right. We provide a detailed derivation of Eq. (A.18) in Appendix F using only basic properties of the partially transposed permutations.",
    "A crucial property of the EPR state is that it is invariant under the action of 𝑈 ⊗ 𝑈 * for any 𝑈 .",
    "This follows because (𝑈 ⊗ 1)𝑃 EPR = (1 ⊗ 𝑈 𝑇 )𝑃 EPR and 𝑈 * 𝑈 𝑇 = 1. Hence, when a mixed unitary (𝑈 ) ⊗𝑝 ⊗ (𝑈 * ) ⊗𝑞 is applied to a subspace with exactly ℓ EPR pairs, its action on each of the ℓ EPR pairs becomes trivial. This leaves 𝑝-ℓ copies of 𝑈 and 𝑞 -ℓ copies of 𝑈 * remaining. To formalize this, for each value of ℓ we define a partial isometry Ĩℓ (see Appendix F for details) that maps each ℓ-EPR subspace ℋ ⊗𝑝 ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞 to the ℓ-th Hilbert space on the right side of Eq. (A.18). The partial isometries provide an orthogonal decomposition of the full Hilbert space, 1 = ∑︀ ℓ Ĩ † ℓ Ĩℓ , where each Ĩ † ℓ Ĩℓ projects onto the subspace of exactly ℓ EPR pairs. We then show that one can re-write the mixed Haar twirl as,",
    "where the action of the mixed unitary twirl is \"pulled\" inside each partial isometry to act on the Hilbert space",
    "One can then compute each twirl explicitly, which yields",
    "Here, we apply the formula in Lemma 5 for the mixed Haar twirl for each ℓ. The only partially transposed permutations that contribute correspond to tensor products 𝜎 ≡ 𝜋 𝐿 ⊗𝜋 𝑅 and 𝜏 ≡ π𝐿 ⊗ π𝑅 . Every partially transposed permutation besides these contains at least one EPR projector and hence vanishes inside Ĩ † ℓ (•) Ĩℓ . The trace is partial over",
    "]︀ nE and does not act on 𝒜 ℓ . We refer to Appendix F for full details. This completes our exact reformulation of the mixed Haar twirl. To provide a more intuitive picture of its behavior, we will now derive our simpler approximate expression. Before doing so, let us first recall the approximate formula for the standard Haar twirl from Ref. [36]:",
    "Lemma 1 of Ref. [36] (Approximation for Haar twirl).",
    "For any 𝑘 2 ≤ 𝐷, the Haar twirl is approximated by,",
    "). The approximate formula is accurate up to exponentially small error and enables much easier applications due to its simplicity. In effect, it replaces the Weingarten matrix Wg 𝜋,π in the exact Haar twirl with the identity matrix (1/2 𝑛𝑘 )𝛿 𝜋,π .",
    "We can now provide a similar simplification for the mixed Haar twirl.",
    "Lemma 8 (Approximation for the mixed Haar twirl). For any 𝑘 2 ≤ 𝐷, the mixed Haar twirl is approximated by,",
    ", for 𝜀 = (𝑝 + 𝑞) 2 /𝐷. The approximate mixed Haar twirl can be equivalently written as, Similar to the standard Haar twirl, our approximation in effect replaces the Weingarten matrix in Eq. (A. 19) by the product of identity matrices, (1/𝐷 𝑝-ℓ )𝛿 𝜋 𝐿 ,π 𝐿 and (1/𝐷 𝑞-ℓ )𝛿 𝜋 𝑅 ,π 𝑅 . We provide a proof of the lemma in Appendix A.2.3, In addition to its technical convenience, the approximate mixed Haar twirl provides an intuitive picture for the behavior of random unitaries in experiments involving time-reversal. Consider a quantum experiment querying 𝑈 and 𝑈 † (or 𝑈 * or 𝑈 𝑇 ) many times. First, within the experiment, some subset of the applications of 𝑈 might cancel with applications of 𝑈 † (or 𝑈 * , etc.). The number of cancellations corresponds to the ℓ in our earlier discussion, and the pairing of the cancellations corresponds to the register 𝒜 ℓ . In principle, a quantum experiment could be a superposition of many different pairings, hence 𝒜 ℓ is a quantum register. Then, among the un-cancelled applications, 𝑈 and 𝑈 † behave indistinguishably from two independent random unitaries 𝑈 and 𝑉 . This is the statement of Lemma 8: After pulling 𝑈 and 𝑈 * inside the partial isometry, their twirl is equal to the tensor product of two standard Haar twirls Φ (𝑝-ℓ) 𝑎 and Φ (𝑞-ℓ) 𝑎 up to small relative error. So the behavior of time-reversal experiments is in some sense very simple: 𝑈 and 𝑈 † either cancel or they act completely independently. The function of the original Weingarten matrix elements and the ensuing partial isometries is solely to keep track of all the different ways that 𝑈 and 𝑈 † might cancel.",
    "We now provide a handful of useful techniques for bounding the relative error of strong unitary designs. Our strategy is as follows. We first establish a technical lemma (Lemma 9) that allows one to bound the relative error between any mixed unitary ensemble and the approximate mixed Haar twirl. We then use this lemma to bound the relative error between the exact mixed Haar twirl and the approximate mixed Haar twirl, which proves Lemma 8. We then combine Lemma 8 with Lemma 9 to prove Lemma 7, which allows one to translate additive to relative errors for strong unitary designs.",
    "Our first technical lemma is as follows. It is inspired by Lemma 7 of Ref. [36] for the standard approximate Haar twirl.",
    "Lemma 9 (Relative error to the approximate mixed Haar twirl). Consider a unitary ensemble ℰ and its mixed twirl Φ (𝑝,𝑞) ℰ",
    ". The mixed twirl is approximated by Φ (𝑝,𝑞) 𝑎 up to relative error,",
    "and 𝑃 EPR is the projector onto the EPR state on (ℋ ⊗𝑝 ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞 ) ⊗2 . Further, let Π nE ≡ Ĩ † ℓ=0 Ĩℓ=0 project to the subspace of ℋ ⊗𝑝 ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞 that is orthogonal to all EPR projectors between a copy on the left side and a copy on the right side.

    "We proceed in four steps. (1) The term in parentheses in the final line of Eq. (A.26) is a projector, i.e. it squares to itself. This follows because the sum over permutations inside the partial isometry is a projector (onto the tensor product of the symmetric subspace [95] of the left and right copy), Π 1 ⊗ Π 2 is a projector (by definition), and these two projectors commute with one another (by assumption). Hence, their product is also a projector. Thus, 𝜌 𝑎 is equal to a sum of projectors with coefficients,",

    "for any 𝜋. Hence, the sum over 𝜋 can be eliminated and the remaining sum over ℓ yields",
    "(3) Steps ( 1) and ( 2",
    "We can compare this with our desired approximation,",
    "Since both the mixed Haar twirl and our desired approximation are a tensor sum over ℓ, the two are close in relative error if and only if they are close in relative error within each partial isometry Ĩℓ . Within each partial isometry, the channels act solely on the no-EPR subspace of ℋ ⊗(𝑝-ℓ) ⊗ ℋ ⊗(𝑞-ℓ) by definition. Hence, to prove the proposition, it suffices to show that Φ",
    "are close in relative error on the no-EPR subspace.",
    "Observing Lemma 9, we can bound this relative error in terms of the spectral norm",
    "Applying the triangle inequality, we find",
    "where we define the (𝑝 -ℓ)!(𝑞 -ℓ)! × (𝑝 -ℓ)!(𝑞 -ℓ)! matrix Â elementwise via the absolute values in the preceding expression.",
    "Since Â has all positive entries, its maximal eigenvalue is achieved by a vector with all positive entries. Moreover, it is invariant under multiplication by any permutation,",
    "Thus, without loss of generality, we can take its maximal eigenvector to be both positive and permutation invariant. This implies that the maximal eigenvalue is achieved by the constant vector. The sum in Eq. (A.32) is thus equal to the maximal eigenvalue multiplied by the matrix dimension, (𝑝 -ℓ)!(𝑞 -ℓ)!.",
    "To determine the maximum eigenvalue of Â, we note that Â is a sub-matrix of the (𝑝 + 𝑞 -2ℓ)! × (𝑝 + 𝑞 -2ℓ)! matrix with entries, |𝛿𝑊 | 𝜎,𝜏 ≡ |2 (𝑝+𝑞-2ℓ) Wg 𝜎,𝜏 -𝛿 𝜎,𝜏 |, where 𝜎, 𝜏 ∈ 𝑆 𝑝+𝑞-2ℓ .

    "In this section, we prove Lemma 2 showing that the blocked fast scrambling circuit is a strong unitary 2-design. The circuit has depth 𝒪(log 𝑛 • log 𝑛/𝜀) when each small random unitary is instantiated with a 1D random circuit of depth 𝒪(log 𝑛/𝜀). This forms a key building block in our random circuit construction of strong unitary 𝑘-designs, as described in the main text. Our proof of Lemma 2 proceeds in two steps. First, we introduce and prove a simple proposition that quantifies when any unitary ensemble forms a strong approximate unitary 2-design. Our proposition leverages a well-known mapping from 2-designs to classical Markov processes on the set of Pauli operators [55,97]. We show that the measurable error of a strong approximate 2-design is upper bounded by the total variational distance between the Markov process associated to the circuit ensemble, and that associated to the Haar ensemble. Second, we prove that this total variational distance is small for the blocked fast scrambling circuit, which completes the proof.",
    "Let us first review the mapping from unitary 2-designs to Markov processes, and formally state our proposition. Consider the action of the unitary 𝑈 ⊗ 𝑈 * on ℋ ⊗ ℋ, where 𝑈 is drawn from any ensemble ℰ that is invariant under random single-qubit rotations at the input and output. To understand the action of the unitary, we consider the complete basis of states,",
    "where |Ψ EPR ⟩ is the EPR state and 𝑃 runs over all 4 𝑛 Pauli operators. The invariance of ℰ under random single-qubit rotations guarantees that the twirl over ℰ can be written in the following form,",
    "where 𝑝 ℰ (𝑄; 𝑃 ) is a normalized probability distribution over Pauli operators 𝑄, for each Pauli operator 𝑃 . For a Haar-random unitary, we have 𝑝 𝐻 (𝑄; 𝑃 ) = 1/(4 𝑛 -1).",
    "Our proposition is as follows.",
    "Proposition 2. Consider any unitary ensemble ℰ is invariant under conjugation, transposition, and random single-qubit Pauli rotations at the input and output circuit layer. The ensemble forms a strong approximate unitary 2-design with measurable error,",
    "in any quantum experiment that queries one of 𝑈 or 𝑈 𝑇 and one of 𝑈 * or 𝑈 † .",
    "The proposition does not cover experiments that query two of 𝑈 or 𝑈 𝑇 and neither of 𝑈 * or 𝑈 † (and vice versa). We will address such experiments using standard unitary design features later on.",
    "Proof of Proposition 2. Without loss of generality, we consider an experiment that first queries 𝑈 † and then queries 𝑈 . The remaining seven classes of experiments follow by symmetric arguments 8 . The output state 𝜌 of any such experiment can be written as (Fig. 5)",
    "where |Ψ⟩ is a normalized quantum state. Taking the twirl over ℰ yields,",
    "where 𝑆 Y→A swaps register Y to register A, and is obtained from the multiplying the Bell pairs,",
    "Let us denote each state in the final line above as 𝜌 𝑃 𝑄 which acts on AB. With this notation, the final line becomes",
    "We also let 𝛿𝑝(𝑃, 𝑄) = 𝑝 ℰ (𝑃, 𝑄) -𝑝 𝐻 (𝑃, 𝑄). We can bound the additive error as follows,",
    "The first step uses the triangle inequality, the second step uses ‖𝜌 𝑃 𝑄 ‖ 1 = ‖𝜌 𝑃 1 ‖ 1 since the 1-norm is invariant under Pauli rotations, the third step uses the definition of the total variational distance, the fourth step uses Holder's inequality, and the final step uses",
    "This completes the proof.",
    "We can now proceed to the proof of Lemma 2.",
    "Proof of Lemma 2. There are sixteen classes of experiments that a strong unitary 2-design must capture, corresponding to whether the first query is to 𝑈 , 𝑈 𝑇 , 𝑈 * , or 𝑈 † and similar for the second query. Let us first consider the eight classes of experiment that query two of 𝑈, 𝑈 𝑇 or two of 𝑈 * , 𝑈 † . From the gluing Lemma 3 of Ref. [36], the blocked fast scrambling circuit with small Haar-random unitaries forms a standard approximate unitary 2-design with relative error 4𝑚/2 𝜉 . This implies that the ensemble has measurable error at most 8𝑚/2 𝜉 in any of the eight experiments. Replacing each small random unitary with a relative error 𝜀 𝑛 -approximate unitary 2-design yields an additional measurable error 2𝑚𝜀/𝑛 = 2𝜀/𝜉. Here, we only need to glue 2𝑚 unitaries together in order to realize a standard design via Lemma 3 of Ref. [36]; hence, we only pick up an additional error linear in 𝑚, instead of 𝑚 log 2 𝑚. Thus, the blocked fast scrambling circuit has measurable error at most 8𝑚/2 𝜉 + 𝑚𝜀/𝑛 in any of these eight experiments. Setting 𝜉 ≥ min(log 2 (3𝑛/𝜀), 4) yields an error less than 𝜀.",
    "Let us now turn to the remaining eight experiments, which query one of 𝑈, 𝑈 𝑇 and one of 𝑈 * , 𝑈 † . We will leverage Proposition 2 to bound the measurable error. To begin, we consider the blocked fast scrambling circuit in which each small unitary is Haar-random. Let 𝑃 be any Pauli operator. When a Pauli operator is acted on by a small random unitary within its support, the resulting Pauli operator has support on both patches of the small random unitary with probability 1 -",
    "where the latter term counts the fraction of non-identity Pauli operators on 2𝜉 qubits that have support on only a single patch. Consider any single patch in the support of 𝑃 , and all the small random unitaries within the light-cone of the patch. There are at most 1 + 2 + 4 + • • • + 𝑚 = 2𝑚 -1 such unitaries. Therefore, the probability that every small random unitary in the light-cone spreads the Pauli operator to both patches in its support is at least 1 -(2𝑚 -1)(2/4 𝜉 ). The probability that the time-evolved operator 𝑈 𝑃 𝑈 † has support on every patch of 𝜉 qubits is hence at least this value. We denote this probability as 1 -𝛿 ℰ , with 𝛿 ℰ ≤ 4𝑚/4 𝜉 .",
    "Let us now turn to the action of an 𝑛-qubit Haar-random unitary. Under an 𝑛-qubit Haar-random unitary, the time-evolved operator 𝑈 𝑃 𝑈 † is drawn from the flat distribution on the set of 4 𝑛 -1 non-identity Pauli operators. Therefore, it has support on every patch of 𝜉 qubits with probability",
    "The probability distributions 𝑝 ℰ (𝑃, 𝑄) and 𝑝 𝐻 (𝑃, 𝑄) are both flat among the Pauli operators 𝑄 that have support on every patch of 𝜉 qubits, since both ℰ and 𝐻 are invariant under composition with small random unitaries on each patch. The TVD between the two distributions picks up contributions from two sources. The 𝑄 with full support contribute a factor of |𝛿 𝐻 -𝛿 ℰ | ≤ 𝛿 𝐻 + 𝛿 ℰ , proportional to the difference in the flat value of 𝑝 ℰ (𝑃, 𝑄) and 𝑝 𝐻 (𝑃, 𝑄) on such 𝑄. Meanwhile, the other 𝑄 contribute at most a factor of 𝛿 𝐻 + 𝛿 ℰ , since the two distributions have at most this support on such operators. Thus, the TVD between the two distributions is less than, A.4 Proof of Lemma 3: Strong unitary 𝑘-designs from 1D random circuits",
    "In this section, we provide our proof that one-dimensional local random circuits form strong unitary 𝑘-designs with small relative error in linear depth (Theorem 3 of the main text). Our proof follows the same approach used to show that 1D random circuits form standard unitary designs [32]. This is enabled by our new Lemma 7 which allows one to translate from spectral gaps [32,34,72] to relative error strong unitary designs.",
    "Let us first review a few of the key definitions used in the spectral gap literature [32,34,98]. The central object studied in these works is the so-called moment operator,",
    "of a random unitary ensemble ℰ. To quantify the closeness of the moment operator to the Haarrandom moment operator, we let 𝛿𝑀 = 𝑀 ℰ -𝑀 𝐻 and define the essential norm,",
    "Ref. [34] proves that the ensemble of 1D local random brickwork circuits of depth 𝑑 has essential norm 𝑔(ℰ) ≤ exp (︀ -Ω(𝑑 log 7 𝑘) )︀ . The relationship between the essential norm and the approximation errors of standard unitary designs is well-known. One can bound ‖𝛿Φ(𝜌)‖ ∞ ≤ 𝑔(ℰ) for any 𝜌 when 𝛿Φ = Φ",
    "𝐻 is defined with respect to the standard twirl [32]. This allows one to bound the relative error via Lemma 6. In what follows, we show that this approach proceeds identically for strong unitary designs after replacing Lemma 6 with our Lemma 7.",
    "and 𝑝 + 𝑞 = 𝑘. The relationship between the essential norm and the spectral norm when 𝛿Φ is applied to a state follows from a straightforward series of equalities,",
    "where |𝜌⟩ denotes the vectorization of 𝜌. Hence, an upper bound on the essential norm immediately translates to an identical upper bound on the spectral norm of 𝛿Φ(𝜌) for any state 𝜌. The two inequalities are saturated when 𝜌 is pure and equal to the extremal eigenvector of 𝛿𝑀 . In previous works, the equalities above are applied when 𝛿Φ is defined with respect to the standard twirl [32]. In this case, the 𝑘 copies of 𝑈 in 𝛿𝑀 act on the left (\"ket\") side of the vectorization of 𝜌, and the 𝑘 copies of 𝑈 * act on the right (\"bra\") side. However, an identical bound holds for the mixed twirl as well. In this case, we have 𝑝 copies of 𝑈 and 𝑞 copies of 𝑈 * that act on the left side of the vectorization of 𝜌, and 𝑞 copies of 𝑈 and 𝑝 copies of 𝑈 * that act on the right side. Since there 𝑘 copies of both 𝑈 and 𝑈 * in total, the remaining steps proceed identically regardless of the value of 𝑝, 𝑞.",

Our second lower bound is specific to local random circuits and the relative error metric. It shows that local random circuits require depth Ω(𝑛) to form relative error strong unitary designs in any circuit geometry. This contrasts with the measurable error, where we achieved local random circuit designs in depth 𝒪(log 2 𝑛) in Theorem 1.",

    "After compression by Compress LRF , the actions of the two oracles are identical aside from a normalization ratio of √︀ 1 -(ℓ + 𝑟)/𝑁 . The 𝑊 ′ and lrfO ′ oracles are block-diagonal between different values of ℓ, 𝑟. Hence, the spectral norm of the difference between the two operators (after compressing lrfO ′ ) is bounded by the maximum spectral norm of the difference for each ℓ, 𝑟. From the above analysis, the two oracles are related by a constant re-scaling √︀ 1 -(ℓ + 𝑟)/𝑁 ≥ 1 -(ℓ + 𝑟)/𝑁 within each ℓ, 𝑟. Hence, the spectral norm of their difference is at most (ℓ + 𝑟)/𝑁 . Applying ℓ + 𝑟 ≤ 𝑡 completes the proof.",

This fact also implies that each sum in parentheses above is a projector. Hence, lrfO ′ is equal to the product of lrfO and four projectors. From Eq.

    "Proof. According to [79], for 𝑓 : {0, 1} 𝑛 → Z 𝑞 computable in logspace-uniform TC 1 , there is a poly(𝑛)size reversible circuit 𝐶 ′ that maps |𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤⟩ ↦ → |𝑝(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤)⟩ (E.4)",
    "where 𝑝(𝑥, 0, 0 ℓ , 𝑤) = (𝑥 ′ , 𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑎 ′ , 𝑤), but on other inputs, 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤) may be arbitrary. Given such a circuit 𝐶 ′ , we can implement 𝐶 satisfying Definition 43, where the trusted ancilla is now size ℓ + 𝑂(1), using standard techniques from reversible computation:",
    "1. On input |𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤⟩, parse 𝑎 as (𝑦 ′ , 𝑎 ′ ), where 𝑦 ′ ∈ Z 𝑞 and 𝑎 ′ is length ℓ. Run 𝐶 ′ on (𝑥, 𝑦 ′ , 𝑎 ′ , 𝑤). This step does not affect the 𝑦 register, and the effect on |𝑥, 𝑎, 𝑤⟩ is:",
    "Add the value of 𝑦 ′ out onto |𝑦⟩.",
    "The result is that we have performed the map",
    "where 𝑦 ′ out is a function of (𝑥, 𝑎 = (𝑦 ′ , 𝑎 ′ ), 𝑤), which equals 𝑓 (𝑥) when 𝑎 = (𝑦 ′ , 𝑎 ′ ) = (0, 0 ℓ ).",
    "We will now define two further restricted classes of ancilla-preserving implementations, and we will show how to compile circuits satisfying Definition 43 into circuits satisfying these more restricted notions.",
    "Recall that an ancilla-preserving implementation of 𝑓 is a circuit 𝐶 that maps (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤) to (𝑥, 𝑦 + 𝑔(𝑥, 𝑎, 𝑤), 𝑎, 𝑤), where 𝑔 is any function that agrees with 𝑓 when 𝑎 = 0. We now define two more restrictive notions where we impose further requirements on 𝑔.",
    "Definition 44 (Stronger versions of ancilla-preserving implementations). Let 𝐶 be an ancilla-preserving implementation of 𝑓 , and let 𝑔 be as in Definition 43. Then we say that 𝐶 is:",
    "• an ancilla-independent implementation of 𝑓 if 𝑔(𝑥, 𝑎, 𝑤) = 𝑓 (𝑥) for all 𝑎, 𝑤.",
    "Next, we show that an ancilla-preserving implementation of a function 𝑓 , |𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤⟩ ↦ → |𝑥, 𝑦 + 𝑔(𝑥, 𝑎, 𝑤), 𝑎, 𝑤⟩ , can be efficiently converted into an ancilla-controlled implementation of 𝑓 ,",
    "where the trusted ancilla space 𝒜 is unchanged and 𝒲 ′ = 𝒲 × Z 𝑞 .",

Moreover, the size and depth of 𝐶 ′ is bounded in terms of 𝐶: 9 and",
    "Proof. Let us introduce a new register Q supported on states |𝑧⟩ for 𝑧 ∈ Z 𝑞 . Suppose we could implement the following maps:",
    "we can compose these operations to obtain the desired ancilla-controlled implementation:",

    "Implementing O. For 𝑖 ∈ Z 𝑞 let 𝐶 (𝑖) be the circuit that applies 𝐶 controlled on element 𝑧 in the Q register satisfying 𝑧 ≤ 𝑖. Given an implementation of 𝐶, we can implement 𝐶 (𝑖) by replacing each gate 𝑔 with the gate 𝑔 (𝑖) , which implements 𝑔 controlled on the element 𝑧 in the Q register satisfying 𝑧 ≤ 𝑖. Since 𝑞 = 𝑂(1), this only requires a constant number of additional elementary gates. Then 𝑂 can be implemented as 𝑂 = 𝐶 (𝑞) 𝐶 (𝑞-1) • • • 𝐶 (1) .",
    "Implementing 𝑊 . 𝑊 is an ℓ + 𝑂(1) qubit unitary, so it has a 2 𝑂(ℓ) -size ancilla-free implementation.",
    "Finally, we give a simple transformation from ancilla-controlled implementations to ancilla-independent implementations of 𝑓 . The transformation preserves the ancilla registers but has a size and depth blowup of 2 ℓ .",
    "Lemma 33. Let 𝐶 be an ancilla-controlled implementation of 𝑓 , i.e., it implements the map |𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤⟩ ↦ → |𝑥, 𝑦 + 𝜒 𝑎=0 ℓ • 𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑎, 𝑤⟩. There is an ancilla-independent implementation of 𝑓 , i.e., a circuit 𝐶 ′ that maps |𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑎, 𝑤⟩ ↦ → |𝑥, 𝑦 + 𝑓 (𝑥), 𝑎, 𝑤⟩, with size Θ(2 ℓ • |𝐶|) and depth Θ(2 ℓ • depth(𝐶)).",

It is clear that the ancilla-independent implementations compose, completing the proof.",
    "In this section, we proceed from studying ancilla-independent implementations of functions to studying ancilla-independent implementations of unitaries. We say that 𝐶 is an ancilla-independent implementation of a unitary 𝑈 (acting on Hilbert space X) if 𝐶 implements the map 𝑈 X ⊗ Id A .",

    "To prove this theorem, we wish to make use of the LRFC construction (Theorem 4). To do so, we must first give an ancilla-independent implementation of a pseudorandom ternary phase oracle. This is achieved via the following lemma. Finally, we observe that, letting 𝑅 Y denote the increment operator on Y,",
    "Finally, we prove Theorem 14 by combining Theorem 13 with Theorem 6. Recall that Theorem 6 states that the following construction yields a strong PRU when its building block unitaries are instantiated with strong PRUs:",
    "• Apply a 2-design.",
    "• Apply two brickwork layers of building block unitary gates.",
    "• Apply an independent 2-design.",
    "We will use this construction twice to prove Theorem 14. First, we instantiate a high-depth version of the construction, where:",
    "• The building block unitaries act on 2 • 𝑛 𝜖 qubits.",
    "• The input register is divided into 𝑛 1-𝜖 blocks of 𝑛 𝜖 qubits.",
    "• Given an ancilla-independent implementation of the building block unitary using 𝑛 𝛼•𝜖 ancilla qubits (for some constant 𝛼 > 0), we construct a circuit from the glued unitary in which each building block unitary uses adjacent registers as its ancilla space.",
    "This construction results in a quantum circuit implementation of a distribution of unitaries that is pseudorandom on its entire domain by the gluing lemma. However, its depth is large, especially because all gates in the \"brickwork layers\" must now be concatenated sequentially due to the circuit implementations having overlapping registers. Nevertheless, this yields the high-depth case of Theorem 14. Moreover, if the initial ancilla-independent PRU family is sub-exponentially secure, then so is the ancilla-free PRU family. Finally, under this sub-exponential security assumption, we can plug our ancilla-free PRU back into Theorem 6, using block size poly(log 𝑛), yielding an ancilla-free PRU family of depth poly(log 𝑛).",
    "In this Appendix, we provide further details on our analysis of the mixed Haar twirl. This completes our proof of the additive-to-relative error translation result (Lemma 7) for strong unitary designs. We also provide several additional results on the mixed Haar twirl not used in this work.",
    "In this section, we provide the full details of the derivation of our reformulation of the mixed Haar twirl [Eq. (A. 19)], which was used to prove Lemma 7 in Appendix A.2.3. Our derivation uses only basic properties of the partially transposed permutations. Nonetheless, it requires several detailed steps to formally construct the partial isometries Ĩℓ and prove their essential properties.",
    "For the ease of the reader, we structure this section in a pedagogical format. We first motivate and introduce the relevant objects one-by-one. We then provide a series of short proofs of their key properties, which leads to our reformulated expression for the mixed Haar twirl. We hope that our analysis may be useful in future works on the mixed Haar twirl, even beyond the context of strong unitary designs.",
    "As previously discussed, we can write the exact expression for the mixed Haar twirl in terms of the partially transposed permutations (PTPs),",
    "where 𝜎 = 𝜋 Γ and 𝜏 = (π) Γ correspond to the original permutation operators with the partial transpose Γ applied on the right 𝑞 copies. The summation is over all (𝑝 + 𝑞)! possible PTPs for both 𝜎 and 𝜏 . We also let ̃︂ Wg 𝜎,𝜏 ≡ Wg 𝜋,π denote the analog of the Weingarten matrix elements for the PTPs.",
    "Let us begin by reviewing a few basic facts regarding the PTPs. We denote a mixed tensor unitary (MTU) acting on ℋ ⊗𝑝 ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞 as, 𝒰 𝑝 𝑞 ≡ 𝑈 ⊗𝑝 ⊗ 𝑈 *,⊗𝑞 , (F.2)",
    "for any 𝑈 ∈ 𝑈 (𝐷) with 𝐷 = 2 𝑛 . We can draw each PTP using tensor network notation, ,",
    "where the \"left\" 𝑝 copies are depicted above the dashed line of the diagram, and the \"right\" 𝑞 copies are depicted below the dashed line. One can easily verify that any PTP commutes with any MTU,",
    "This is especially clear in the diagrammatic depiction of the PTP. Each 𝑈 in the MTU either slides from the right to left of the PTP, or cancels with a 𝑈 * acting on a paired leg of the PTP. The PTPs form a generating set for the commutant of the MTUs, i.e. any operator that commutes with every MTU can be written as a sum of PTPs10 .",
    "The PTPs form a representation of the so-called \"walled Brauer algebra\", ℬ 𝐷 𝑝,𝑞 . The multiplication rules of the algebra can be computed by connecting the legs of the associated PTPs. For example, (F. 5) where each closed loop contributes a factor of the Hilbert space dimension 𝐷. The representation is faithful whenever 𝐷 ≥ 𝑝 + 𝑞, i.e. a linear combination of PTPs is equal to zero, ∑︀ 𝜎 𝑐 𝜎 𝜎 = 0, if and only if each coefficient is zero 11 , 𝑐 𝜎 = 0.",
    "Having defined the PTPs, we now begin our own analysis. Let us first introduce some useful notation. We can uniquely label each PTP by a set of four quantities, depicted as follows, (F.6)",
    "The first quantity, 𝜎 𝐼 , specifies the input legs that are paired under 𝜎 (purple). We term the number of pairs in 𝜎 𝐼 the size of the PTP, and denote it as ℓ 𝜎 = |𝜎 𝐼 |, where | • | counts the number of pairs. We have 0 ≤ ℓ 𝜎 ≤ min(𝑝, 𝑞). The second quantity, 𝜎 𝑂 , specifies the output legs that are paired under 𝜎 (blue). The number of output pairs is also ℓ 𝜎 , equal to the number of input pairs. The third quantity, 𝜎 𝐿 ∈ 𝑆 𝑝-ℓ𝜎 , specifies a permutation acting on the remaining 𝑝 -ℓ 𝜎 legs on the left side (green). Similarly, the fourth quantity, 𝜎 𝑅 ∈ 𝑆 𝑞-ℓ𝜎 , specifies a permutation acting on the remaining 𝑞 -ℓ 𝜎 legs on the right side (red).",
    "The main aim of this section is to show that the PTPs naturally decompose the Hilbert space ℋ ⊗𝑝 ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞 into a tensor sum of orthogonal subspaces. Our derivation of this decomposition requires several steps. To begin, we note that a subset of the PTPs with 𝜎 𝐿 = 𝜎 𝑅 = 1 and 𝜎 𝐼 = 𝜎 𝑂 ≡ 𝛼 (for any set of pairs 𝛼), are proportional to projectors. Namely, we have 𝜎 2 = 𝐷 ℓ𝜎 𝜎 for any such PTP where ℓ 𝜎 = |𝛼|. This allows us to define the \"bare\" projectors,",
    "Each 𝑃 𝛼 projects onto the EPR state on each pair in 𝛼, and acts as the identity on copies not in 𝛼.",
    "In general, the bare projectors are not orthogonal to one another. For example, whenever 𝛼 ⊃ 𝛽, the subspace defined by 𝑃 𝛼 is strictly contained within the subspace defined by 𝑃 𝛽 (i.e. 𝑃 𝛼 𝑃 𝛽 = 𝑃 𝛼 ). This fact can make working with the bare projectors somewhat inconvenient. To address this, we will need to orthogonalize the bare projectors.",
    "We do so by introducing a new object: the no-EPR projector. For any subset 𝛽 of the 𝑝 + 𝑞 copies, we define the no-EPR projector, Π nE 𝛽 , as the projector onto the subspace of the Hilbert space of 𝛽 that is orthogonal to every EPR projector on 𝛽. That is, we let Π nE 𝛽 project onto the orthogonal complement of {𝑃 𝛼 : 𝛼 ⊇ 𝛽}. In the special case when 𝛽 contains every copy, we simply write Π nE , which is the projector onto the orthogonal complement of {𝑃 𝛼 : ∀𝛼 ̸ = ∅}. We will write down an explicit expression for the no-EPR projector at the end of this subsection. For now, we simply note that the no-EPR projector can be written as a sum of PTPs supported on 𝛽, since it commutes with every MTP unitary and acts as the identity on β.",
    "We can use the no-EPR projector to (partially) remedy the non-orthogonality of the bare projectors. For each set of pairs 𝛼, we define the \"nearly-orthogonal\" projectors, (F. 8) where |𝐸 𝛼 ⟩ denotes the EPR state on all pairs in 𝛼. Here, the slash represents the no-EPR projector on ᾱ, and each diamond represents a factor of the inverse square root Hilbert space dimension, However, the nearly-orthogonal projectors are not orthogonal to one another when |𝛼| = |𝛽|.",
    "To address this latter fact, we can define a final set of \"orthogonal\" projectors, P𝛼 . We do so via the Gram-Schmidt process. For each size ℓ = 0, . . . , min(𝑝, 𝑞), we consider any ordering, {𝛼 0 , 𝛼 1 , . . .}, of the pairings 𝛼 with size |𝛼| = ℓ. We then proceed 𝛼-by-𝛼 through the ordering, and at each step define the orthogonal projector P𝛼 as, Unlike the individual orthogonal projectors P𝛼 , the projector Pℓ is uniquely defined, independent of our ordering of the pairings 𝛼 within each size ℓ.",
    "We can now demonstrate several useful properties of the orthogonal projectors. We begin by proving (Appendix F.1.5) that the orthogonal projectors can be written as a sum of PTPs.",
    "Proposition 5 (Orthogonal projectors). Each projector P𝛼 can be written as a sum of PTPs with either (i) size greater than |𝛼|, or (ii) size equal to |𝛼| and 𝛼 𝐼 , 𝛼 𝑂 ≤ 𝛼 with respect to the ordering in Eq. (F.9).",
    "Intuitively, this follows because the Gram-Schmidt process constructs an orthogonal vector by taking a linear combination of the current vector and all vectors previous to it.",
    "We also have the following useful fact (Appendix F.1.6).",
    "Proposition 6 (The ℓ-EPR projector). The projector Pℓ commutes with every PTP.",
    "This does not apply to the individual orthogonal projectors P𝛼 . We can also characterize the rank of each orthogonal subspace.  EPR is tricky to compute in general. However, one has an immediate upper bound, 𝑁",
    "Before proceeding, we pause to provide the following explicit expression for the no-EPR projector Π nE . This expression is not needed for any of the results in the preceding sections; we mention it solely for completeness for the interested reader. The expression is as follows (Appendix F.1.8).",
    "Proposition 8 (Expression for the no-EPR projector). For any 𝑝 + 𝑞 ≤ 𝐷. The inner product of the no-EPR projector, Π nE , with a permutation operator, 𝜋 𝐿 ⊗ 𝜋 𝑅 , is given by,",
    "where Ŵg| perm is the (𝑝!𝑞!)×(𝑝!𝑞!) sub-matrix obtained by restricting the (𝑝+𝑞)!×(𝑝+𝑞)! Weingarten matrix, Ŵg, to the permutation operators. As a consequence, the no-EPR projector can be written as a sum of PTPs with coefficients,",
    "The expression for the no-EPR projector is not particularly easy to work with, given that it involves the inverse of a sub-matrix of the Weingarten matrix. We provide further discussion and applications in Appendix F.2",
    "The mixed Haar twirl has a particularly simple action on the orthogonal subspaces constructed in the previous subsection. To show this, let us first discuss the bare projectors, and then turn to the orthogonal projectors. Each bare projector 𝑃 𝛼 naturally defines a partial isometry from the (𝑝 + 𝑞)copy Hilbert space to a smaller (𝑝 + 𝑞 -2|𝛼|)-copy Hilbert space, .",
    "The 𝑝 + 𝑞 -2|𝛼| copies correspond to the legs of the PTP that are not paired in 𝛼. The isometries are unitary-equivariant, , (F. 16) meaning that the action of any MTU on the (𝑝 + 𝑞)-copy Hilbert space translates to a corresponding smaller MTU on the (𝑝 + 𝑞 -2|𝛼|)-copy Hilbert space.",
    "We will now show that an analogous set of isometries can be constructed for the orthogonal projectors P𝛼 . We define these carefully in the following manner.",
    "(F.19) To proceed, let us take the square root of the middle operators,",
    "where 𝑀 ′ ᾱ acts on ᾱ. We prove that the square root is well-defined within the proof of Proposition 9 (Appendix F.1.9), by showing that the operator inside the parentheses is a positive operator. From the right hand side, we can see that 𝑀 𝛼 = 𝑀 𝛼 𝑃 𝛼 = 𝑃 𝛼 𝑀 𝛼 . Thus, we can write where we have P𝛼 = Ĩ † 𝛼 Ĩ𝛼 from Eq. (F.21). This completes our definition of the partial isometries. We establish a few key properties of the partial isometries (Appendix F.1.9). Proposition 9 (Partial isometries). For any 𝐷 ≥ 𝑝 + 𝑞, the map Ĩ𝛼 is well-defined and is an isometry from the support of P𝛼 to the no-EPR subspace of ℋ ⊗𝑝-|𝛼| ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞-|𝛼| . The isometry is unitary-equivariant, Ĩ𝛼 (𝒰 𝑝 𝑞 ) = (𝒰 𝑝-ℓ 𝑞-ℓ ) Ĩ𝛼 .",
    "The range of the isometry is restricted to the no-EPR subspace of ℋ ⊗𝑝-|𝛼| ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞-|𝛼| , in contrast the bare isometry defined earlier which maps to the entire space. This reflects the smaller size of P𝛼 compared to 𝑃 𝛼 . We can also define a final set of partial isometries, Ĩℓ , associated to the ℓ-EPR projectors Pℓ . These will play a particularly important role since, as aforementioned, the definition of Pℓ is unique and independent of our ordering of the 𝛼, in contrast to P𝛼 . The support of Pℓ is equal to the tensor sum of the support of each P𝛼 with size |𝛼| = ℓ. Hence, the partial isometry Ĩℓ will map from this domain to the",
    ")︀ ℓ!-fold tensor sum of the range of each Ĩ𝛼 . Each Ĩ𝛼 has range equal to the no-EPR subspace of ℋ ⊗𝑝-|𝛼| ⊗ ℋ ⊗𝑞-|𝛼| . Hence, the range of Ĩℓ will be equal to,",
    ")︀ ℓ! counts the number of 𝛼 with size |𝛼| = ℓ, i.e. the number of terms in the tensor sum. The first term denotes the no-EPR subspace of ℋ ⊗(𝑝-ℓ) ⊗ ℋ ⊗(𝑞-ℓ) . With the range defined, we write the partial isometry as, Ĩℓ = ∑︁",
    "where on the right side, we move the action of the MTU to the inside of the partial isometry. We suppress the 𝒜 ℓ , 𝒜 ℓ ′ registers for brevity, since the MTU acts trivially on these registers. We can now apply the formula for the mixed Haar twirl in terms of PTPs to each term ℓ, ℓ ′ above. This yields,",
    "where Wg (𝑝+𝑞-2ℓ)",
    "𝜋 𝐿 ⊗𝜋 𝑅 ,π 𝐿 ⊗π 𝐿 denotes the Weingarten matrix on 𝑝+𝑞-2ℓ copies. To compute this expression, we note that any PTP with size greater than zero vanishes upon conjugation by Ĩℓ , since the range of Ĩℓ is the no-EPR subspace (Proposition 9) and PTPs with size greater than zero involve at least one EPR projector. This implies that the terms with ℓ ̸ = ℓ ′ vanish, and that the remaining ℓ = ℓ ′ terms involve only tensor products permutation operators between the left and right side, 𝜋 𝐿 , π𝐿 ∈ 𝑆 𝑝-ℓ and 𝜋 𝑅 , π𝑅 ∈ 𝑆 𝑞-ℓ .",
    "This completes our derivation of the reformulation of the mixed Haar twirl. In the remaining subsections, we provide the detailed proofs of each proposition above.",
    "We Since Pℓ can be written as a sum of PTPs with size greater than or equal to ℓ (Proposition 5), the operator Π 𝑖𝑗 Pℓ can also be written as a sum of PTPs with such size (using Fact 5). This implies that Pℓ ′ Π 𝑖𝑗 Pℓ = 0 for any ℓ ′ > ℓ, since Pℓ ′ is orthogonal to any PTP with size greater than ℓ by definition. Applying the same argument to the Hermitian conjugate, ( Pℓ ′ Π 𝑖𝑗 Pℓ ) † = Pℓ Π 𝑖𝑗 Pℓ ′ , we have that Pℓ ′ Π 𝑖𝑗 Pℓ = 0 for any ℓ ′ < ℓ, and hence ℓ ′ ̸ = ℓ. The desired commutation follows immediately. We write",
    "where in the first equality we use that the projectors form a complete basis, ∑︀",
    "Note that the latter expression, Eq. (F.32), contains only PTPs with 𝛼 𝐼 , 𝛼 𝑂 < 𝛼. Since the representation of the walled Brauer algebra is faithful for 𝐷 ≥ 𝑝 + 𝑞, this implies that the former expression, Eq. (F.31), must also contain only such PTPs. This follows because the PTPs are linearly independent operators when the representation is faithful. We will now show that this leads to a contradiction. To begin, recall that we can write (F.33) The first term contains solely PTPs with 𝛼 𝐼 = 𝛼 𝑂 = 𝛼. Thus, if Eq. (F.31) can be written as a sum of PTPs with 𝛼 𝐼 , 𝛼 𝑂 < 𝛼, we must have 𝑐 𝜋 𝐿 𝜋 𝑅 = 0 for all 𝜋 𝐿 , 𝜋 𝑅 . This implies that ⟨𝜓 ᾱ|𝜓 ᾱ⟩ is zero, which implies that |𝜓⟩ is zero, which is a contradiction. We conclude that every non-zero vector in span(𝑃 nE 𝛼 ) is outside span({𝑃 𝛼 ′ : 𝛼 ′ ≤ 𝛼}). This implies that the rank of P𝛼 is equal to the rank of 𝑃 nE 𝛼 , which proves the proposition.",
    "Let us first prove Eq. (F.13). We know from Proposition 5 that the no-EPR projector can be written as a sum of PTPs. Hence, we can write,",
    "where 𝜎, 𝜏 run over the (𝑝 + 𝑞)! PTPs. We can simplify this expression in two ways. First, we use that tr (︀ Π nE 𝜎 )︀ = 0 unless 𝜎 is a permutation, 𝜎 = 𝜋 𝐿 ⊗ 𝜋 𝑅 . Second, we can use that (Π nE ) 2 = Π nE to multiply the right hand side by Π nE . This similarly restricts the sum over 𝜏 , since 𝜏 Π nE = 0 unless 𝜏 is a permutation, 𝜏 = π𝐿 ⊗ π𝑅 . Together, these give",
    "To proceed, consider the operators, {(π 𝐿 ⊗ π𝑅 )Π nE }, appearing on the right side of Eq. (F.35). We will prove that these operators are linearly independent. Suppose that there exists coefficients, 𝑐 π, for π ≡ π𝐿 ⊗ π𝑅 , such that ∑︀ π 𝑐 π πΠ nE = 0. Now, the no-EPR projector can be written as",
    "Pℓ , where each projector Pℓ can be written as a sum of PTPs with size greater than or equal to ℓ ≥ 1. Hence, we can write ∑︀ π 𝑐 π πΠ nE = ∑︀ π 𝑐 π π + ∆, where ∆ is a sum of PTPs with size ≥ 1. If the left side of this expression were to vanish, as supposed, than the first term on the right side must vanish as well, since the PTPs are linearly independent for 𝑝 + 𝑞 ≤ 𝐷, and the first term has only PTPs of size zero and the second term has only PTPs of size ≥ 1. However, this requires 𝑐 π = 0 for all π, since the permutation operators are linearly independent as well. This establishes that that the operators, {(π 𝐿 ⊗ π𝑅 )Π nE }, are linearly independent.",
    "We can use this linear independence to complete our proof. Observing Eq. (F.35), the only way in which the two sides of the equation can be equal is if,",
    "for every π𝐿 , π𝑅 . The second term on the left side of the equation are the matrix elements of Ŵg| perm .",
    "Applying the matrix inverse of Ŵg| perm to the left and right side, we obtain Eq. (F.13), as desired.",
    "The second statement of the proposition, Eq. (F. non-zero eigenvalues 𝜆, corresponding to the dimension of the no-EPR subspace on ᾱ. However, from Proposition 7, this is also the rank of P𝛼 . Hence, there must be precisely this number of non-zero eigenvalues, and the set of conjugated vectors, { | λ⟩}, must be linearly independent. To determine the eigenvalues 𝜆, let us apply P𝛼 to | λ′ ⟩ for any λ′ . We have",
    "Since the { | λ⟩} are linearly independent, we must have ⟨ λ| λ′ ⟩ = 𝛿 λ, λ′ and 𝜆 • 𝒩 𝜆 = 1. Hence, 𝜆 = 1/𝒩 𝜆 , so every eigenvalue is positive and greater than one.",

    "Lemma 35 (Bound on the inverse Weingarten sub-matrix). For any (𝑝 + 𝑞) 2 ≤ 𝐷/2. The sum of the absolute values of the matrix elements of the inverse of Ŵg perm are bounded as",
    "where we abbreviate 𝜋 = 𝜋 𝐿 ⊗ 𝜋 𝑅 , π = π𝐿 ⊗ π𝑅 .",
    "Proof. Since Ŵg| perm is a sub-matrix of Ŵg, its maximum eigenvalue is upper bounded by the maximum eigenvalue of Ŵg, and its minimum eigenvalue is lower bounded by the minimum eigenvalue of Ŵg. This follows since 𝑣 𝑇 Ŵg𝑣 = 𝑣| 𝑇 perm Ŵg| perm 𝑣| perm for any vector 𝑣 with support only on the permutation operators. From Ref. [96], the maximum eigenvalue of Ŵg is less than 1 + (𝑝 + 𝑞) 2 /𝐷 and the minimum eigenvalue of Ŵg is greater than 1 -(𝑝 + 𝑞) 2 /𝐷. Hence, the eigenvalues of Ŵg| perm are bounded by these values.",
    "Since the eigenvalues are bounded away from zero, the matrix inverse of Ŵg| perm can be Taylor expanded,",
    "Subtracting this expression from the identity matrix, the 𝑚 = 0 term is canceled, and so we have",
    "We can bound our quantity of interest, the sum of absolute value matrix elements on the left, by a series of similar sums on the right,",
    "which follows from the triangle inequality.",
    "To evaluate the terms within parentheses on the right hand side, we recall that the matrix elements of Ŵg| perm have an alternating pattern of signs, (-1) |𝜋 𝐿 |+|𝜋 𝑅 | . If we define the diagonal matrix P element-wise via 𝑃 𝜋,𝜋 = (-1) |𝜋 𝐿 |+|𝜋 𝑅 | , this implies that P Ŵg| perm P is has all positive entries [103].",
    "Since the diagonal elements of Ŵg| perm are greater than one, we further have that P ( Ŵg| perm -1) P has all positive entries [36,104]. Taking the 𝑚-th power, we find that ( P ( Ŵg| perm -1) P ) 𝑚 = P ( Ŵg| perm -1) 𝑚 P has all positive entries as well. The elements of these matrices have the same absolute values as the elements of the terms (1 -Ŵg) 𝑚 . Hence, the sum over the absolute value of the matrix elements of the latter is equal to the same sum for the former.",
    "The sum over matrix elements of P ( Ŵg| perm -1) 𝑚 P is easy to evaluate, since the matrix has all positive elements. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem and the fact that the matrix is invariant under permutations, the maximum eigenvector of P ( Ŵg| perm -1) 𝑚 P is the constant vector, 𝑣 𝜋 = 1/ √ 𝑝!𝑞! [36]. Hence, the maximum eigenvalue is equal to",
    "which is precisely the sum we would like to bound. From the above expression, we immediately have",
    "We have ‖ Ŵg| perm -1‖ ∞ ≤ (𝑝 + 𝑞) 2 /𝐷 from our discussion of the eigenvalues of Ŵg| perm . Hence, the right side is less than ((𝑝 + 𝑞) 2 /𝐷) 𝑚 . We can complete our proof by inserting this bound into the Taylor series and performing the sum over 𝑚. This yields,",
    "where the final inequality holds if (𝑝 + 𝑞) 2 ≤ 𝐷/2. This completes our proof.",
    "Both Ĝ(ℓ) and F (ℓ,ℓ ′ ) have entirely positive matrix elements. The Perron-Frobenius theorem then states that the maximum eigenvalue of each matrix is achieved by an eigenvector with entirely positive elements. Moreover, both Ĝ(ℓ) and F (ℓ,ℓ ′ ) possess a \"permutation symmetry\",",
    "𝜋(𝛼)𝜋(𝛽) , (F.54)",
    "and similar for F (ℓ,ℓ ′ ) . Here, 𝜋 = 𝜋 𝐿 ⊗ 𝜋 𝑅 is any tensor product of permutations on the left and right side. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the maximum eigenvector, 𝑣 𝛼 , is invariant under the permutation symmetry, 𝑣 𝛼 = 𝑣 𝜋(𝛼) for any 𝜋. (If not, we simply average the maximum eigenvector over all of its possible permutations, which produces a symmetric vector with the same eigenvalue.) Since for every 𝛼, 𝛽, there exists a permutation 𝜋 such that 𝜋(𝛼) = 𝛽, we have 𝑣 𝛼 = 𝑣 𝛽 for all 𝛼, 𝛽. Hence, the maximum eigenvalues of Ĝ(ℓ) and F (ℓ,ℓ ′ ) are achieved by the constant vector, 𝑣 𝛼 = 1/ ( ∑︀ 𝛼 1) To bound the sum in Eq. (F.55), we count the number of sets of pairs 𝛼 that have spectral norm ‖𝑃 nE 𝛽 𝑃 nE 𝛼 ‖ ∞ = 𝐷 𝐿-ℓ with a fixed set of pairs 𝛽, for each value of 𝐿. Let us denote this number as 𝑁 (𝐿, ℓ). Recall that 𝛼 is a sequence of ℓ pairs of indices. To determine 𝑁 (𝐿, ℓ), we enumerate the possible 𝛼 pair-by-pair, as depicted below.",
    "(F. 58) In more detail, let 𝛽 (0) = 𝛽 consider the \"right half\" of 𝑃 nE 𝛼 , the isometry 𝐼 nE 𝛼 = Π nE ᾱ ⊗ ⟨𝐸 𝛼 |. The first pair, 𝛼 1 , can be placed on any left and any right index, as long as at least one of the indices is contained in 𝛽 (0) . (If neither index is contained in 𝛽 (0) , then the pair is annihilated by the no-EPR projector Π nE β .) There are at most ℓ(𝑝 + 𝑞) possible choices of the first pair, since: the index in 𝛽 (0) can come from either the left or right side; on that side, the index corresponds to one of ℓ pairs; and on the other side, the index can be any of either 𝑞 or 𝑝 values. Among these possible choices, there are ℓ possible choices of the first pair that produce a loop, since 𝛽 (0) has ℓ pairs.",
    "After the first pair is chosen, we can take the product of 𝑃 nE 𝛽 and |𝐸 𝛼 1 ⟩ to obtain a new projector 𝑃 nE 𝛽 (1) . The new set 𝑃 nE 𝛽 (1) acts on 𝑝 -1, 𝑞 -1 indices, and 𝛽 (1) always contains one fewer pair than 𝛽 (0) . To verify the latter statement, note that there are three possible classes of pairs 𝛼 1 that can be added. The first class connects one index of a pair in 𝛽 to one index in β. This action annihilates the pair, and thus reduces the total number of pairs by one. The second class connects one index of a pair in 𝛽 to another index of another pair in 𝛽. This action joins the two pairs, and thus also reduces the number of pairs by one. The final class connects two indices of the same pair in 𝛽, producing a loop. Again, this reduces the total number of pairs by one.",
    "We can iterate this process ℓ times to enumerate all possible sequences, 𝛼, of ℓ pairs, such that 𝑃 nE 𝛽 𝑃 nE 𝛼 is non-zero. At the 𝑗-th step, for 𝑗 = 1, . . . , ℓ, there are (ℓ-𝑗 +1)(𝑝+𝑞) total possible choices for the 𝑗-th pair, and, among these, (ℓ -𝑗 + 1) possible choices that produce a loop. At the end of the process, each set of pairs 𝛼 is over-counted a total of ℓ! times, corresponding to the possible orderings of the pairs in 𝛼. If one wishes to consider only 𝛼 that produce exactly 𝐿 loops, there are",
    ")︀ possible choices of 𝐿 steps at which to produce a loop. Putting these three facts together, we have that there are at most, The upper bound of the second sum is ℓ -1 and not ℓ because 𝛼 = 𝛽 is the sole choice of 𝛼 that yields ℓ pairs, and this choice is excluded in the first sum.",
    "Proof of the second statement, Eq. (F.43) right. We now turn to F . The spectral norm is To bound the right hand side, we proceed similarly to our analysis for Ĝ, and enumerate all possible 𝛾, 𝛽 that give a non-zero value of ‖𝑃 nE 𝛼 𝑃 𝛾 𝑃 nE 𝛽 ‖ ∞ . We begin with 𝛾 and proceed pair-by-pair as before. Let 𝛼 (0) = 𝛼 and 𝐼 nE 𝛼 (0) = Π nE ᾱ(0) ⊗ ⟨𝐸 𝛼 (0) |. We place the first pair, 𝛾 1 , on any two of the 𝑝 + 𝑞 indices, so long as at least one of the indices is in 𝛼 (0) . (If it is not, then both indices of the pair are in ᾱ(0) , and so are annihilated by the no-EPR projector in 𝐼 nE 𝛼 (0) .) This produces a new isometry, 𝐼 nE 𝛼 (1) = 𝐼 nE 𝛼 (0) |𝐸 𝛾 1 ⟩, acting on 𝑝 + 𝑞 -2 copies with ℓ -1 EPR projectors, as depicted in Eq. (F.58). We iterate this procedure 𝑗 = 1, . . . , ℓ ′ times to generate all valid 𝛾 with ℓ ′ pairs. At the 𝑗-th step, there are (ℓ -𝑗 + 1)(𝑝 + 𝑞 -2𝑗) possible locations at which to place the 𝑗-th pair, and, among these, (ℓ -𝑗 + 1) possible locations that produce a loop. In total, each 𝛾 is over-counted a total of ℓ ′ ! times, corresponding to the possible orderings of the ℓ ′ pairs in 𝛾.",
    "At the end of the process above, we obtain an isometry 𝐼 nE 𝛼 (ℓ ′ ) = 𝐼 nE 𝛼 |𝐸 𝛾 ⟩ acting on 𝑝 + 𝑞 -2ℓ ′ copies, with ℓ -ℓ ′ EPR projectors. The isometry is given by multiplying the \"right half\" of 𝑃 nE 𝛼 with the \"left half\" of 𝑃 𝛾 . To proceed to enumerate the valid 𝛽, let us multiply this isometry by the \"right half\" of 𝑃 𝛾 , to obtain 𝐼 nE 𝛿 (0) ≡ 𝐼 nE 𝛼 |𝐸 𝛾 ⟩⟨𝐸 𝛾 | = 𝐼 nE 𝛼 𝑃 𝛾 . The isometry 𝐼 nE 𝛿 (0) acts on 𝑝 + 𝑞 copies with ℓ EPR projectors. We can now enumerate the possible 𝛽 pair-by-pair, exactly as we did in our analysis of Ĝ. At the 𝑗-th step, for 𝑗 = 1, . . . , ℓ, there are (ℓ -𝑗 + 1)(𝑝 + 𝑞 -2𝑗) possible locations at which to place the 𝑗-th pair, and, among these, (ℓ -𝑗 + 1) possible locations that produce a loop. Each 𝛽 is over-counted a total of ℓ! times, corresponding to the possible orderings of the ℓ pairs in 𝛽.",
    "We can now count the total number of 𝛾, 𝛽 that produce 𝐿 loops in the multiplication 𝑃 nE 𝛼 𝑃 𝛾 𝑃 nE 𝛽 . Since the enumeration of 𝛾, 𝛽 contained a total of ℓ ′ + ℓ steps, there are",

    "This follows from the well-known fact that the representation of the permutation group 𝑆 𝑘 on ℋ ⊗𝑘 is faithful when 𝐷 ≥ 𝑘. A linear combination of PTPs is equal to zero if and only if its partial tranpose is equal to zero. Since the representation of the permutation group is faithful, this can be true only if every coefficient is equal to zero."
