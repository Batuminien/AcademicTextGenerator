  "title": "Fundamental Limit of Discrete Distribution Estimation under Utility-Optimized Local Differential Privacy",
  "authors": [],
  "abstract": "We study the problem of discrete distribution estimation under utility-optimized local differential privacy (ULDP), which enforces local differential privacy (LDP) on sensitive data while allowing more accurate inference on non-sensitive data. In this setting, we completely characterize the fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. The converse proof builds on several key ideas, including a generalized uniform asymptotic Cramér-Rao lower bound, a reduction showing that it suffices to consider a newly defined class of extremal ULDP mechanisms, and a novel distribution decomposition technique tailored to ULDP constraints. For the achievability, we propose a class of utilityoptimized block design (uBD) schemes, obtained as nontrivial modifications of the block design mechanism known to be optimal under standard LDP constraints, while incorporating the distribution decomposition idea used in the converse proof and a score-based linear estimator. These results provide a tight characterization of the estimation accuracy achievable under ULDP and reveal new insights into the structure of optimal mechanisms for privacy-preserving statistical inference.",

        "Local differential privacy (LDP) [1]- [3] has already been deployed at scale in industry [4]- [8]. Under LDP, each individual perturbs their data locally before transmission so that the reported value reveals provably little about the true record, thereby removing the need for a trusted curator [1], [2]. Formally, LDP bounds how much the distribution of a user's reported value can differ as their true data vary, thereby embedding privacy directly at the source. This user-level privacy guarantee-quantified through information-theoretic bounds [9, Thm. 14]-has propelled LDP into a wide spectrum of statistical inference and machine-learning tasks involving sensitive data [7], [10]- [14].",
        "However, LDP offers blanket protection: for any pair of input values, the distribution of reported data must remain nearly indistinguishable [9]. Although such protection is reassuring, it can be inefficient in scenarios where only certain S.-M. Yoon, H.-Y. Park, and S.-H.

        "inputs are truly sensitive. Consider the survey, \"Have you violated a policy?\", with X ∈ {\"Yes\", \"No\"} as the truthful answer, adapted from the illustrative example in [15]. Under Warner's randomized response (RR) [10] shown in Fig. 1 (a), respondents flip a biased coin and potentially report the opposite answer. Consequently, the reported value Y conveys only limited information about X, restricting the analyst's ability to infer the true outcome. Notably, however, only the affirmative response (\"Yes\") is genuinely sensitive, while the negative response (\"No\") is not. Mangat's randomized response [16] in Fig. 1 (b), exploits this asymmetry: those who answered \"Yes\" always report truthfully, while those who answered \"No\" randomize their answer. This ensures privacy when Y = \"Yes\", while enabling reliable inference when Y = \"No\". Utility-optimized local differential privacy (ULDP) [15] formalizes this idea. A ULDP mechanism partitions outputs into protected symbols-subject to the full LDP guarantee-and invertible symbols that faithfully reveal non-sensitive inputs. Thus, ULDP preserves LDPlevel privacy exactly where needed, while permitting enhanced inference elsewhere. This approach has motivated extensions such as high-low LDP [17], (ϵ, δ)-ULDP [18], [19], inputdiscriminative LDP [20], [21], and utility-optimized key-value data LDP [22]. Furthermore, ULDP has already seen adoption in domains including clinical analytics [23], federated learning [24], and natural language processing [25].",
        "For the representative statistical inference task of discrete distribution estimation, which is the focus of this paper, several ULDP schemes have been proposed [15], [17], [26], [27]. As will be elaborated in Section III, prior ULDP schemes have been analyzed only with respect to order-optimality in specific regimes [15], [17], [27], while the exact leading constant that characterizes the fundamental limit of the PUT under ULDP has not been identified. This unresolved gap motivates our work, which establishes the exact attainable performance."

Notably, the class of uBD schemes subsumes one of the existing schemes, uRR [15], and our closed-form characterization implies that uRR is optimal in some regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to prove the optimality of uRR in a certain regime. Furthermore, we show that there exists a regime in which previously proposed ULDP schemes cannot achieve the optimal PUT, thereby establishing the strict superiority of our uBD scheme."

To mitigate privacy leakage, the i-th client perturbs its data X i into Y i through a conditional distribution Q : X → P(Y) for some finite set Y, called a privacy mechanism, and transmits Y i to the server. After collecting Y n = (Y 1 , . . . , Y n ), the server computes the estimate Pn : Y n → R w of P . Let P denote a sequence of estimators ( Pn ) ∞ n=1 and we call the pair (Q, P ) a private estimation scheme. The estimation error of a private estimation scheme (Q, P ) with n clients is measured by the worst-case mean squared error (MSE),",

Note that (w, ϵ)-ULDP is equivalent to ϵ-LDP. Also, (7) indicates that whenever the event {Y ∈ Y I } occurs, the server can perfectly infer the input x ∈ X N of a ULDP mechanism. Thus, roughly speaking, an (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanism provides partly more accurate data than an ϵ-LDP mechanism.",

        "Discrete distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) has been extensively studied, and a variety of LDP schemes have been proposed such as randomized response (RR) [10], randomized aggregatable privacy-preserving ordinal response (RAPPOR) [7], subset selection (SS) [11], Hadamard response (HR) [12], projective geometry response (PGR) [13], optimized unary encoding (OUE) protocol [14], and optimized local hasing (OLH) protocol [14]. Among these, the SS is known to attain the optimal PUT M * (w, w, ϵ) [31]. Recently, Park et al. [29] introduced a class of block design schemes that subsumes RR, SS, HR, and PGR while also enabling the construction of new mechanisms that achieve optimal PUT with reduced communication costs.",
        "Turning to the utility-optimized LDP (ULDP) setting, proposed ULDP schemes are typically derived by modifying classical LDP schemes to satisfy the ULDP requirements in Definition 1. Concretely, uRR and uRAP [15] are derived from RR [10] and RAPPOR [7], respectively; uSS [27] is based on SS [11]; uOUE and uOLH [26], [27] are based on OUE and OLH [14]; and a variant of the Hadamard response [17]-referred to here as uHR-extends HR [12] to the ULDP constraint. To characterize the optimal PUT under ULDP, Murakami et al. [15] utilized Remark 1 and known results in PUT over LDP in [2] to show that for ϵ ∈",
        "Then, they stated that uRAP attains an estimation error of 4v nϵ 2 as ϵ → 0; hence, it is order-optimal for ϵ ∈ [0, 1]. Subsequently, Acharya et al. [12] refined the optimal PUT as M * n (w, v, ϵ) = Θ v 2 nϵ 2 + w nϵ for the high privacy regime ϵ = O(1), and introduced the uHR scheme whose estimation error matches this rate up to constant factors. 1Recently, [27] showed that M * n (w, v, ϵ) = Θ ve ϵ n(e ϵ -1) 2 for ϵ ≤ log v, and uSS, uOUE, and uOLH are order-optimal in the regime ϵ ≤ log v, which was also proved from Remark 1 and results in PUT over LDP in [11]. Furthermore, it was experimentally shown that uSS [27] achieves the lowest estimation error among previous schemes.",

This subsection revisits the classical asymptotic CRLB and sketches the key ideas behind the uniform refinement of [31]. In Section V-A, we extend the uniform version of [31] substantially, laying the groundwork for showing the converse of the optimal PUT under ULDP.",

Then, by refining the classical proof of asymptotic CRLB in [33], [34], commonly referred to as the local asymptotic normality (LAN) argument, they derived a certain universal lower bound on inf P R n (Q, P ), holding for all extremal ϵ-LDP mechanisms Q.

The concave-convex property of M (α, t) and the existence of a saddle point is proved in Appendix B.",

Then, we introduce a novel argument of decomposing the data distribution P into three components: (i) the relative values of P x 's over sensitive x, (ii) the relative values of P x 's over non-sensitive x, and (iii) the total probability of sensitive data P (X S ). Using this, we derive a lower bound on M * (w, v, ϵ) which can be interpreted as the sum of CRLBs for estimating each component. Each M i in Theorem 3 can be intuitively interpreted as the CRLB for estimating the i-th component of the data distribution P .",
        "For achievability, we propose a class of utility-optimized block design schemes (uBD schemes). Each uBD scheme is associated with parameters (α, t) appearing in Theorem 3, and we show that if (α * , t * ) is a saddle point of M , then every uBD scheme with parameter (α, t) = (α * , t * ) is asymptotically optimal. The privacy mechanism Q of a uBD scheme builds upon the block design mechanisms [29] in Definition 3, with nontrivial modifications. The distinguishing idea is to exploit a mixture of multiple BD mechanisms, rather than restricting to a single BD mechanism. The parameter t represents the mixture proportions, where t k denotes the proportion of a k-uniform BD mechanism. The estimator sequence is constructed based on two ideas. First, we adopt the idea, also utilized in the converse proof, of decomposing the data distribution P into three components, and estimate each component separately. Second, we propose a set of estimator sequences { P (α) } α∈[0,1] , each of which attains the Cramér-Rao lower bound at a specific data distribution P (α) ∈ ∆ w . The supremum over α in Theorem 3 reflects the intuition that for the worst-case optimality, we use the estimator sequence that attains the worst-case CRLB. To attain the CRLB, the idea of 'score-based linear estimator' in [30] is utilized.",

Based on these ideas, we observe that by the symmetries of block designs, for any given α ∈ (0, 1), the expectation of the projection of the score vector of a uBD mechanism at P (α) (defined in (54)) is a linear function of the projection of P -P (α) , where the linear coefficient is related with M i apperaing in Theorem 3 and d i := dim(H i ).",

An exception is the case of v ≥ 2, t = δ (v;v) , where the linear relationship is non-invertible due to M 1 (α, t) = ∞.

    "Local differential privacy (LDP) [1]- [3] has already been deployed at scale in industry [4]- [8]. Under LDP, each individual perturbs their data locally before transmission so that the reported value reveals provably little about the true record, thereby removing the need for a trusted curator [1], [2]. Formally, LDP bounds how much the distribution of a user's reported value can differ as their true data vary, thereby embedding privacy directly at the source. This user-level privacy guarantee-quantified through information-theoretic bounds [9, Thm. 14]-has propelled LDP into a wide spectrum of statistical inference and machine-learning tasks involving sensitive data [7], [10]- [14].",
    "However, LDP offers blanket protection: for any pair of input values, the distribution of reported data must remain nearly indistinguishable [9].

    "inputs are truly sensitive. Consider the survey, \"Have you violated a policy?\", with X ∈ {\"Yes\", \"No\"} as the truthful answer, adapted from the illustrative example in [15]. Under Warner's randomized response (RR) [10] shown in Fig. 1 (a), respondents flip a biased coin and potentially report the opposite answer. Consequently, the reported value Y conveys only limited information about X, restricting the analyst's ability to infer the true outcome. Notably, however, only the affirmative response (\"Yes\") is genuinely sensitive, while the negative response (\"No\") is not. Mangat's randomized response [16] in Fig. 1 (b), exploits this asymmetry: those who answered \"Yes\" always report truthfully, while those who answered \"No\" randomize their answer. This ensures privacy when Y = \"Yes\", while enabling reliable inference when Y = \"No\". Utility-optimized local differential privacy (ULDP) [15] formalizes this idea. A ULDP mechanism partitions outputs into protected symbols-subject to the full LDP guarantee-and invertible symbols that faithfully reveal non-sensitive inputs. Thus, ULDP preserves LDPlevel privacy exactly where needed, while permitting enhanced inference elsewhere. This approach has motivated extensions such as high-low LDP [17], (ϵ, δ)-ULDP [18], [19], inputdiscriminative LDP [20], [21], and utility-optimized key-value data LDP [22]. Furthermore, ULDP has already seen adoption in domains including clinical analytics [23], federated learning [24], and natural language processing [25].",
    "For the representative statistical inference task of discrete distribution estimation, which is the focus of this paper, several ULDP schemes have been proposed [15], [17], [26], [27]. As will be elaborated in Section III, prior ULDP schemes have been analyzed only with respect to order-optimality in specific regimes [15], [17], [27], while the exact leading constant that characterizes the fundamental limit of the PUT under ULDP has not been identified. This unresolved gap motivates our work, which establishes the exact attainable performance.",
    "Our main contribution is to establish the exact optimal PUT-including the leading constant-for discrete distribution estimation under ULDP. We characterize the optimal PUT in terms of a finite-dimensional concave-convex saddlepoint optimization problem that can be solved using convex optimization solvers and give a closed-form solution to this optimization problem for some regime.",
    "For converse, we develop two general analytical frameworks which extend previous works: (i) a uniform asymptotic Cramér-Rao lower bound, a versatile concept applicable beyond ULDP to general private estimation problems, and (ii) a reduction showing that optimal ULDP mechanisms can be restricted to a newly defined class of extremal ULDP mechanisms, analogous to extremal LDP mechanisms [28], thereby confining the minimax analysis to this smaller class. After that, we complete the converse proof by exploiting a novel way to decompose the data distribution into several parts based on the structure of the ULDP constraint.",
    "For achievability, we propose a class of utility-optimized block design (uBD) schemes. The development of uBD schemes builds on several key ideas: (i) nontrivially modifying block design schemes [29] for discrete distribution estimation under LDP, (ii) exploiting the idea of score-based linear estimator in [30], and (iii) decomposing the data distribution as in the converse proof. Notably, the class of uBD schemes subsumes one of the existing schemes, uRR [15], and our closed-form characterization implies that uRR is optimal in some regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to prove the optimality of uRR in a certain regime. Furthermore, we show that there exists a regime in which previously proposed ULDP schemes cannot achieve the optimal PUT, thereby establishing the strict superiority of our uBD scheme.",
    "The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II formalizes the discrete distribution estimation problem under the ULDP constraint. Section III provides the necessary background and a review of the related works. Our main result-the characterization of the optimal PUT-is stated in Section IV. To establish the optimal PUT, Section V presents the converse proof, and Section VI establishes achievability through the proposed uBD scheme. Section VII provides the numerical evaluations of the proposed scheme and baselines on a realworld dataset, demonstrating that our scheme outperforms existing alternatives. Finally, Section VIII concludes the paper with some discussion on future works.",

To mitigate privacy leakage, the i-th client perturbs its data X i into Y i through a conditional distribution Q : X → P(Y) for some finite set Y, called a privacy mechanism, and transmits Y i to the server. After collecting Y n = (Y 1 , . . . , Y n ), the server computes the estimate Pn : Y n → R w of P .

We denote the class of all (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanisms by Q w,v,ϵ . Also, a private estimation scheme (Q, P ) which satisfies Q ∈ Q w,v,ϵ is called a (v, ϵ)-ULDP scheme. Note that (w, ϵ)-ULDP is equivalent to ϵ-LDP. Also, (7) indicates that whenever the event {Y ∈ Y I } occurs, the server can perfectly infer the input x ∈ X N of a ULDP mechanism. Thus, roughly speaking, an (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanism provides partly more accurate data than an ϵ-LDP mechanism.",
    "The optimal privacy-utility tradeoff (or, in short, optimal PUT) for a discrete distribution estimation system with nclients under (v, ϵ)-ULDP constraint is defined as",
    "In [15], it was shown that M * n (w, v, ϵ) = Θ(1/n). Accordingly, the asymptotically optimal PUT is defined as",

Note that M * (w, w, ϵ) is the optimal PUT under the ϵ-LDP constraint, which has already been established in [11]. Hence, from now on, we assume v < w.",
    "Remark 1. The following inequalities follow directly from the relation between LDP and ULDP:",
    "In Remark 3, we show that the above bound is, in fact, tight under specific conditions.",
    "Discrete distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) has been extensively studied, and a variety of LDP schemes have been proposed such as randomized response (RR) [10], randomized aggregatable privacy-preserving ordinal response (RAPPOR) [7], subset selection (SS) [11], Hadamard response (HR) [12], projective geometry response (PGR) [13], optimized unary encoding (OUE) protocol [14], and optimized local hasing (OLH) protocol [14]. Among these, the SS is known to attain the optimal PUT M * (w, w, ϵ) [31]. Recently, Park et al. [29] introduced a class of block design schemes that subsumes RR, SS, HR, and PGR while also enabling the construction of new mechanisms that achieve optimal PUT with reduced communication costs.",
    "Turning to the utility-optimized LDP (ULDP) setting, proposed ULDP schemes are typically derived by modifying classical LDP schemes to satisfy the ULDP requirements in Definition 1. Concretely, uRR and uRAP [15] are derived from RR [10] and RAPPOR [7], respectively; uSS [27] is based on SS [11]; uOUE and uOLH [26], [27] are based on OUE and OLH [14]; and a variant of the Hadamard response [17]-referred to here as uHR-extends HR [12] to the ULDP constraint. To characterize the optimal PUT under ULDP, Murakami et al. [15] utilized Remark 1 and known results in PUT over LDP in [2] to show that for ϵ ∈",
    "Then, they stated that uRAP attains an estimation error of 4v nϵ 2 as ϵ → 0; hence, it is order-optimal for ϵ ∈ [0, 1]. Subsequently, Acharya et al. [12] refined the optimal PUT as M * n (w, v, ϵ) = Θ v 2 nϵ 2 + w nϵ for the high privacy regime ϵ = O(1), and introduced the uHR scheme whose estimation error matches this rate up to constant factors. 1Recently, [27] showed that M * n (w, v, ϵ) = Θ ve ϵ n(e ϵ -1) 2 for ϵ ≤ log v, and uSS, uOUE, and uOLH are order-optimal in the regime ϵ ≤ log v, which was also proved from Remark 1 and results in PUT over LDP in [11]. Furthermore, it was experimentally shown that uSS [27] achieves the lowest estimation error among previous schemes.",
    "Despite these advances, the exact optimal PUT under ULDP, in particular the determination of the leading constant, had remained an open problem until our work, where we establish a complete characterization.",
    "A well-known result in asymptotic statistics [32]- [34] is an asymptotic variant of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB), which we refer to as the asymptotic Cramér-Rao lower bound (asymptotic CRLB). In [31], a key step in establishing the converse of the optimal PUT under LDP is to derive a certain uniform version of the asymptotic CRLB, suitable for distribution estimation under LDP. This subsection revisits the classical asymptotic CRLB and sketches the key ideas behind the uniform refinement of [31]. In Section V-A, we extend the uniform version of [31] substantially, laying the groundwork for showing the converse of the optimal PUT under ULDP.",
    "The standard asymptotic CRLB [32,Theorem 29.4] implies that for a fixed conditional distribution Q from [w], we have",

However, this cannot be directly applied to derive a lower bound on the optimal PUT under LDP, which involves the infimum over the privacy mechanisms Q inside the limit over n. To circumvent this challenge, the authors of [31] first reduced the optimization over all ϵ-LDP mechanisms to the optimization over a specific class of ϵ-LDP mechanisms, called the extremal ϵ-LDP mechanisms introduced in [28]. Then, by refining the classical proof of asymptotic CRLB in [33], [34], commonly referred to as the local asymptotic normality (LAN) argument, they derived a certain universal lower bound on inf P R n (Q, P ), holding for all extremal ϵ-LDP mechanisms Q. This gives",

In [29, Prop. 1 and Thm. 5], an explicit characterization of optimal k that minimizes the estimation error is provided and the BD scheme with optimal k is shown to achieve the optimal PUT.

    "Our main contribution is to completely characterize the optimal PUT for the discrete distribution estimation under the ULDP constraint, i.e., the characterization of M * (w, v, ϵ) for all possible (w, v, ϵ).",
    "Here, M (α, t) is concave-convex and has a saddle point (α * , t * ), which gives sup α inf t M (α, t) = M (α * , t * ). 3For Theorem 3, the converse and the achievability parts are shown in Sections V and VI, respectively. The concave-convex property of M (α, t) and the existence of a saddle point is proved in Appendix B.",

Then, we introduce a novel argument of decomposing the data distribution P into three components: (i) the relative values of P x 's over sensitive x, (ii) the relative values of P x 's over non-sensitive x, and (iii) the total probability of sensitive data P (X S ). Using this, we derive a lower bound on M * (w, v, ϵ) which can be interpreted as the sum of CRLBs for estimating each component. Each M i in Theorem 3 can be intuitively interpreted as the CRLB for estimating the i-th component of the data distribution P .",
    "For achievability, we propose a class of utility-optimized block design schemes (uBD schemes). Each uBD scheme is associated with parameters (α, t) appearing in Theorem 3, and we show that if (α * , t * ) is a saddle point of M , then every uBD scheme with parameter (α, t) = (α * , t * ) is asymptotically optimal. The privacy mechanism Q of a uBD scheme builds upon the block design mechanisms [29] in Definition 3, with nontrivial modifications. The distinguishing idea is to exploit a mixture of multiple BD mechanisms, rather than restricting to a single BD mechanism. The parameter t represents the mixture proportions, where t k denotes the proportion of a k-uniform BD mechanism. The estimator sequence is constructed based on two ideas. First, we adopt the idea, also utilized in the converse proof, of decomposing the data distribution P into three components, and estimate each component separately. Second, we propose a set of estimator sequences { P (α) } α∈[0,1] , each of which attains the Cramér-Rao lower bound at a specific data distribution P (α) ∈ ∆ w . The supremum over α in Theorem 3 reflects the intuition that for the worst-case optimality, we use the estimator sequence that attains the worst-case CRLB. To attain the CRLB, the idea of 'score-based linear estimator' in [30] is utilized.",

Since the proposal of uRR in [15], this is the first proof of its optimality in a certain regime. Corollary 6 shows that uSS scheme, which is the best known previous scheme, is suboptimal, thereby demonstrating a strict gap between uBD and the previously known ULDP schemes.",

    "As a first step for the converse proof, we show the generalization of the uniform result in [31], which we call the uniform asymptotic Cramér-Rao lower bound (uniform asymptotic CRLB). Our version of uniform asymptotic CRLB covers the general private discrete distribution estimation, not only private estimation under LDP or ULDP constraint, and thus we expect that it has possible applications to other private estimation problems. Moreover, we provide a much shorter proof for the uniform asymptotic CRLB compared to [31].",

We omit B from the subscript if it is clear from the context. Remark 4. Fisher information matrices with respect to different orthonormal bases are conjugate via an orthogonal matrix. Therefore, many expressions involving trace of a function of Fisher information matrix (such as tr -1 (J P,Q ) in (13)) are invariant under the choice of basis. If so, we may omit the subscript B without ambiguity.",
    "Next, we present the notion of degradedness [37], which gives a systematic way of reducing the space of privacy mechanisms to be optimized, as [31] reduced the optimization over all LDP mechanisms to that over extremal LDP mechanisms. Intuitively speaking, we say that Q degrades Q if Q can be simulated by applying some post-processing to the output of Q. The formal definitions are as follows. Definition 6. For finite sets X , Y, Ỹ and two conditional distributions Q : X → P(Y) and Q : X → P( Ỹ), we say Q degrades Q, and denote Q ⊒ Q, if there exists a conditional distribution T : Y → P( Ỹ) such that Q(ỹ|x) = y∈Y Q(y|x)T (ỹ|y) for every x ∈ X and ỹ ∈ Ỹ.

    ". 5 Then, we apply another variant of CRLB, called Bayesian CRLB, resulting that whenever Q ⊒ Q and n ≥ (w -1) 2 /D 4 , we have",
    "b) New Techniques for the Uniform Result: After that, to derive the uniform result, we establish a technical proposition which shows that {P → J P,Q } Q is equicontinuous in some sense. The formal statement is in Proposition 15 in Appendix C-A. Using this proposition and the n -1/4 order of the diameter of the support of Θ, we derive in Appendix C-B that there exist constants C > 0 and N ∈ N (which only depend on (w, P )) such that for every n ≥ N and every conditional distribution Q from [w], we have",

Also, we set Q XS,YI to be the all-zero matrix.",
    "Clearly, every extremal (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanism is a (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanism. Also, note that among previously proposed mechanisms, uRR [15] and uHR [17] are equivalent to some extremal ULDP mechanisms. 6 It turns out that the set of all extremal ULDP mechanisms degrades the class of all ULDP mechanisms.

Now, let Q ∈ Q E w,v,ϵ and α ∈ (0, 1) be given. Let B 1 , B 2 , B 3 be the principal submatrices of J P (α) ,Q;B , where B 1 is formed by selecting the first (v -1) rows and columns, B 2 by selecting the next w -v -1 rows and columns, and B 3 by selecting the last row and column.

Then, a uBD mechanism Q is constructed as follows. The visualization of Q is in Figure 4. If a sensitive data x ∈ X S is given as the input of a uBD mechanism Q, then a uBD mechanism randomly chooses a block design mechanism Q (k) , each with probability t k , respectively, and simulates the chosen Q (k) to generate its output. Hence, in terms of a stochastic matrix, Q XS,YP is the horizontal stack of the stochastic matrices of Q (k) multiplied by t k . After that, we set Q XN,Y so that the resultant Q becomes an extremal (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanism, which is defined in Definition 8. That is, for given x ∈ X N , Q either outputs one of the edges from the support of some Q (k) , or directly outputs its input x in the form of an edge {x}. Here, the output distribution Q(•|x) is suitably determined to maximize the probability that a mechanism outputs {x} while satisfying the (v, ϵ)-ULDP constraint. The precise definition of a uBD mechanism is as follows.",

(ii) Second, by exploiting the decomposition ⃗ ∆ w = H 1 ⊕ H 2 ⊕ H 3 introduced in Section V-C, we construct an estimator based on the relationship between the projections of the unknown distribution P and the score vector onto each of H i . Based on these ideas, we observe that by the symmetries of block designs, for any given α ∈ (0, 1), the expectation of the projection of the score vector of a uBD mechanism at P (α) (defined in (54)) is a linear function of the projection of P -P (α) , where the linear coefficient is related with M i apperaing in Theorem 3 and d i := dim(H i ).",
    "Proposition 10. Let Q be a (w, v, ϵ, t)-uBD mechanism, and α ∈ (0, 1). Then, for each i = 1, 2, 3, we have",
    "Recall that Π i : R w → H i is the orthogonal projection onto H i defined in (50)-(52), and",
    "The proof of Proposition 10 is in Appendix D-A. Using this, we can obtain an unbiased estimator for each of α by inverting the linear relationship for each i = 1, 2, 3 to estimate each Π i (P -P (α) ), and aggregating the results for i's. An exception is the case of v ≥ 2, t = δ (v;v) , where the linear relationship is non-invertible due to M 1 (α, t) = ∞. We note that the idea of score-based linear estimator was used in [30] for private estimation under LDP and a 1-bit communication constraint.",
    "Definition 10. Let Q be a (w, v, ϵ, t)-uBD mechanism. Suppose that t ̸ = δ (v;v) when v ≥ 2. For each α ∈ [0, 1], we define a sequence of unbiased estimators P (α) corresponding to Q, by",

    "Proof. From the concavity of M (α, t) on α, we have",
    "From this, it is clear that when (α, t) = (α * , t * ), the supremum in ( 65) is attained at β = α * , and thus R(Q, P ) = M (α * , t * ). This implies that M (α * , t * ) ≥ M * (w, v, ϵ). Since we have proved in Section V that M (α * , t * ) ≤ M * (w, v, ϵ), we conclude that M (α * , t * ) = M * (w, v, ϵ), and thus R(Q, P ) = M * (w, v, ϵ).",
    "Remark 5. Corollary 12 means that an optimized uBD scheme achieves the minimum possible asymptotic error among all (v, ϵ)-ULDP schemes, which are not necessarily unbiased. Moreover, by the same argument as in [29], we can also show that for each of fixed n, an optimized uBD scheme attains the minimum possible estimation error among all unbiased (v, ϵ)-ULDP schemes.",
    "Note that in all regimes where we find the closed-form solution as in Theorem 4, t * is a point mass. There is a special behavior of uBD schemes such that t is a point mass, which not only derives a simpler description of such schemes, but also plays an important role in the proof of Theorem 4. In short, the estimator P (α) does not depend on α.",

Proposition 13 can be used to implement the estimator for a simple uBD scheme in a simpler way than using (63). As a remark, the (w, v, ϵ, 1)-simple uBD scheme is equivalent to uRR [15].",
    "Granting Theorem 4 about the closed-form solution in some regimes, which is proved in Appendix E, we deduce a closed-form characterization of optimal uBD schemes in the corresponding regimes. Interestingly, for Case (a), we deduce the optimality of uRR [15], which has not been shown before.",

If (X S , E k ) is the complete block design in Remark 2, the corresponding (w, v, ϵ, k)-simple scheme can be seen as a modification of the SS scheme [11]. However, this uBD scheme is not equivalent to the uSS scheme [27], especially because the uBD scheme matches precisely one invertible element to each non-sensitive element, whereas the uSS scheme matches more than one invertible element, thereby introducing additional variance in the estimation.",
    "Remark 7. The main advantage of considering the class of uBD schemes is that we can find an optimal and \"communication-efficient\" ULDP scheme, similar to the class of block design schemes [29]. Here, the communication cost is defined as log 2 |supp(Q)| bits per client. Specifically, a straightforward generalization of the argument in [29, Section IV-B] shows that in the regime of Case (b) in Theorem 4, if there exists a block design with b = v and k ∈ K * (v, ϵ) ∩ [2 : v -1], then there exists a simple uBD scheme which is not only optimal, but also has communication cost of log 2 w. This amount of communication is the smallest possible communication cost required for a consistent estimation [29], [43]. Note that in the regime of Case (a), uRR [15] achieves optimal PUT and the communication cost of log 2 w.",

    "We empirically evaluate the PUTs of uBD and baseline schemes [15], [17], [26], [27]. We use the American Community Survey (ACS) 2023 1-year public use microdata sample (PUMS) [44], which contains records for n = 1, 732, 343 individuals. Six attributes are retained: age, educational attainment, marital status, disability record, employment status, and income-to-poverty ratio, whose category counts are (4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3), giving 288 in total; excluding empty nominal categories yields w = 277 unique input alphabets.",
    "We applied two alternative criteria: (i) Stringent criterion (v = 35): A value is sensitive only if all three conditions hold simultaneously:",
    "• educationally disadvantaged, widowed/divorced, or disabled, • absence from the labor force,",
    "• income below the poverty threshold. (ii) Permissive criterion (v = 253): A value is sensitive if it satisfies any one of the above conditions. The stringent rule labels 79,141 records as sensitive, while the permissive rule identifies 1,022,617.",
    "For each criterion, we randomly sample 50, 000 users twenty times and report the average PUT across these subsamples. Guided by Theorem 4, we partition the privacy budget into three intervals: 10], where (ϵ L , ϵ H ) are in (72)-(73). Figs. 5 and6 show that our scheme consistently outperforms all baselines, regardless of privacy regimes and sensitive-set sizes. In the intermediate regime ϵ ∈ (ϵ L , ϵ H ), where a closed-form expression of the optimal parameter (α * , t * ) is unknown, we plot the empirical values of t * in Fig. 7. Remarkably, t * collapses to the two-point form t * = (t 1 , t 2 , 0, . . . , 0). 8 This observation leads us to carefully conjecture that utilizing a single block design is not sufficient, but utilizing just two block designs-those with k = 1 and k = 2-is sufficient to attain the optimal PUT   VIII. CONCLUSION In this paper, we characterized the optimal PUT for discrete distribution estimation under the ULDP constraint. We proved the converse by leveraging a uniform asymptotic Cramér-Rao lower bound, a reduction to extremal ULDP mechanisms, and a distribution decomposition argument. Also, we proposed a class of PUT-optimal uBD schemes, obtained through nontrivial modifications of block design mechanisms and by employing a score-based estimator together with a distribution decomposition argument.",
    "An interesting direction for future research is to derive closed-form solutions to our optimization problem in the intermediate privacy regime, thereby specifying the optimal parameters for the estimator α * and the mixture proportion t * . Also, we could consider other formulations of PUT, such as instance-optimality setup [45] rather than worst-case setup, and considering general ℓ p loss or f -divergence loss (such as relative entropy) other than MSE loss (ℓ 2 ). It is also of interest to extend the analysis to a broader class of privacy metrics beyond LDP and ULDP. We believe that the analytical tools developed in this paper-particularly the uniform asymptotic Cramér-Rao lower bound-will provide a valuable foundation for pursuing these directions.",

    "Combining this with Proposition 15, we derive (40).",
    "C. Derivation of ( 44) in Theorem 7",
    "We first remark that J P,Q is continuous in Q but it can be singular, and hence tr -1 (J P,Q ) is extended real-valued continuous function on Q. To address this issue, we note that there is an order-preserving homeomorphism σ : R ∪ {-∞, ∞} → [0, 1], e.g., a logistic function σ(x) = 1 1+e -x . Then, by Dini's theorem, σ(R n (P, Q)) ↑ σ (tr -1 (J P,Q )) uniformly as n → ∞, and thus",
    "By taking σ -1 on both sides, we obtain (44).",
    "Let an (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanism Q : X → P( Ỹ) be given, whose sets of protected and invertible data are ỸP and ỸI , respectively. Also, let Y = Y P ⊔ Y I , Y P = 2 [v] \\{∅}, and",
    "and T : Y → P( Ỹ) such that",
    "Suppose that Q ∈ Q E w,v,ϵ is induced from γ : Y P → R ≥0 as in Definition 8. Then, (87) is equivalent to that the following holds for every ỹ ∈ Ỹ:",
    "where Qỹ := ( Q(ỹ|1), • • • , (ỹ|w)), δ (x) := δ (x;w) , and for each z ⊂ X , s (z) ∈ {1, e ϵ } w is defined by",
    "Therefore, it suffices to find γ and T which satisfy (88). By [11,Lemma 12] and the definition of protected data, for each ỹ ∈ ỸP , Qỹ is in a conic hull of {s (z) : z ⊂ X }. Moreover, for each z ⊂ X , s (z) is in a conic hull of S := {s (y) : y ∈ Y P } ∪ {δ (x) : x ∈ X N }, as follows:",
    "Thus, for each ỹ ∈ ỸP , Qỹ is in a conic hull of S. Moreover, for each ỹ ∈ ỸI , Qỹ is a constant multiple of δ (x) for some",
    "x ∈ X N , which is also in a conic hull of S. Thus, for each ỹ ∈ Ỹ, we can write",
    "for some γ(y, ỹ), u(x, ỹ) ≥ 0. Using this, we can observe that (88) is achieved by the following γ and T :",
    "Here, if y ∈ Y P satisfies γ(y) = 0, then we set T (•|y) to be an arbitrary PMF. From (92) and ỹ∈ Ỹ Qỹ = 1 w , it is straightforward to see that above γ satisfies (48) to induce a valid extremal (v, ϵ)-ULDP mechanism, and above T is a valid conditional distribution satisfying ỹ∈ Ỹ T (ỹ|y) = 1. This finishes the proof.",

    "By the definition of the proposed estimator and the law of total expectation, we have",

    "Note that except for the case of v ≥ 2 and t = δ (v;v) , M (α, t) is continuously differentiable with respect to α in a neighborhood of [0, 1]. Thus, again by continuity, it suffices to show (68) for α ∈ (0, 1). Hence, we assume α ∈ (0, 1) from now on.",
    "From (134), we have",
    "It is straightforward to see that",

    "Since both sides of the above equation are affine in β, it suffices to show that",
    "a) Proof of (150): It is easy to see that t(Q) in (58) is equal to t. Hence, by (136), (100), and (58), we have",
    "which shows (150).",
    "b) Proof of (151): Each Q P (β) (y) is affine in β, and hence we can write",
    "Also, from (150), we have",
    "Since P is unbiased, y Q P (α) (y) P1 (y) = P (α) . Thus, combining with (156), we obtain (151).",
    "This ends the derivation of (68).",
    "Let (α * , t * ) be as specified in Theorem 4, with t * = δ (k * ;v) . Here, k * = 1 for Case (a), and",
    "for Case (b). We separately show two equalities,",

    ". This shows (167), and hence ends the proof.",
    "Case (a)-Condition (iii): In this case, we have",
    "and thus α * = 0. By a direct calculation, with t 2 = 1 -t 1 , we obtain",
    ":= e ϵ + 1 (e ϵ -1) 2 1 t 1 + e ϵ (e ϵ + 1) (w -2)(e ϵ -1)",
    "Since f (t 1 ) is convex in t 1 , to show the optimality of t * = δ (1;v) , it suffices to show that f ′ (1) ≤ 0. A straightforward calculation shows that f ′ (1) = w -1 e ϵ (e ϵ -1) 2 (w -2) e 2ϵ -2e ϵw -3 w -1 .",
    "Here, e 2ϵ -2e ϵw-3 w-1 is a quadratic polynomial in e ϵ with roots 1 ± 2(w-2)",
